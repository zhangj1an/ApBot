We built an internal model to reason about appliance execution. The user command is as follows: 

yyyyy

In our model, we want to make the machine to achieve the following goal state: 

wwwww

The past feedbacks we received from the real world is as follows.

hhhhh 

In the feedback string, please look for the variable that starts with "variable_", whose value is closest in meaning to compare with the goal value. 

The extraction rule is as follows:

1. Focus on identifying variables that have meanings most closely related to the goal value. This means that even if the exact spelling or naming does not match, the underlying concept or function should be similar. For example, if the goal string variable is called variable_on_off, but the given feedback has a variable called variable_power, then these two names are referring to the same variable. 

2. As long as the variable name are semantically similar, the variable value does not have to be the same. For example, suppose the goal is to set menu to "popcorn", and currently the feedback says "variable_popcorn_cooking_weight: 200g", then you can select this variable, as it shows the appliance is already in popcorn menu. 

Please list the variable name from the feedback you have identified, and its value. Do not return anything else.
