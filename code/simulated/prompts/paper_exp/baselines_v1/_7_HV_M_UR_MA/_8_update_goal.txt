Attached is our variables code. 

xxxxx 

We want the following effect:

yyyyy 

please return a Python variable_value which contains the desired value of this task. Note that the desired value must be a valid assignable value of this variable according to the given code. 

For example, suppose I have a variable_amount, and the value can range from 1 to 10. if the desired value is 7, then i should return 

variable_value = 7 

suppose i have a variable_menu, the value can be "popcorn" or "rice". If the desired value is "rice", then i should return 

variable_value = "rice"

Plase only return this variable in python and nothing else as i need to directly execute this response.
