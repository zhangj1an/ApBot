Here we attach two images of the appliance. The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. 

You can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: 

press_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.

In particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. 

Currently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: 

zzzzz

The relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:

xxxxx

Currently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. 

Please generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:

action_type = "press_button"
bbox_index = 5 
execution_times = 1 

You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call “press_power_button” by 3 times, you can return:

action_type = "press_button"
bbox_index = 5 
execution_times = 3 

If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call 

action_type = "press_button"
bbox_index = 5 
execution_times = 1

and then call 

action_type = "press_button"
bbox_index = 5 
execution_times = 1

try to call it as 

action_type = "press_button"
bbox_index = 5 
execution_times = 2 

instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return

action_type = "end"
bbox_index = None 
execution_times = None 

If the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 

action_type = "end"
bbox_index = None 
execution_times = None 

to end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this "end" action to save inference cost. 

In particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called "press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning 

action_type = "press_and_hold_button"
bbox_index = [2, 3] 
execution_times = 1
duration = 5

If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. 

Note that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.

You need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:

1. variable_reason (string) – Explains your reasoning, including:
    What has been completed.
    What still needs to be done.
    Why you are choosing a specific action.
2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: "press_button", "press_and_hold_button", "turn_dial_clockwise", "turn_dial_anti_clockwise", or "end". If action_type = "end", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.
3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. 
4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. 
5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. 

Example Scenario:
Suppose you need to set the juicer's power level to "3" by turning the power dial clockwise from "OFF" → "1" → "2" → "3". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.

Your first response should be:

variable_reason = "Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set."
action_type = "turn_dial_clockwise"
bbox_index = 8
execution_times = 3
duration = None 

Guidelines:

Choose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). 
Ensure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.
Only return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().
Your response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.
