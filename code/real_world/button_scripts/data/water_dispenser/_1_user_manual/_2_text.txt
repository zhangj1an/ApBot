**NOTE**

- Do not wet the bottom of the pot. If the pot is turned over while it is wet, the water will flow into the inner part of the pot and can cause the accident.
- Do not use the appliance near the radio, etc. Please keep it away from the place affected by a radio, television, etc. It may cause a loud noise.
- Do not use it near the fire. The pot may be damaged and deformed.
- Do not directly supply the water from the tap into the pot.
- Do not pour out all the water remaining using the button on the control panel.

**BOILING/POURING**

**BOILING**

Put the water in the pot and close the lid. Connect the plug. Then press the button to select the temperature.

- The BOIL indicator will light up. And after the selected TEMP indicator (▼) flashes about 2 seconds, the display will light up instead.
- The display will show the raising water temperature by 5°C at a time. If the temperature is lower than 15°C, Lo will appear.
- The displayed temperature is as a measure. It may change depending on the amount of water or the room temperature.

**When selecting the temperature of “98”**

- When the water boils, the BOIL indicator will light off and the WARM indicator will light up noticeably.

**When selecting the temperature of “85” and “60”**

- When the water boils, the BOIL indicator will light off and the selected WARM indicator will flash.
- When reaching the selected temperature, the WARM indicator will light up noticeably.

| Indication | For |
|------------|-----|
| ▼ 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of “98” Coffee, Chinese tea, instant cup noodle, etc. |
| ▼ 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of “85” Japanese tea, etc. |
| ▼ 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of “60” Mixing milk, etc. (After melting the milk powder, let it cool down to the proper temperature.) |
| ▼ 98 85 60 CLEAN | (Cleaning) Refer to page 13. |

- **The time range of water boiling**
  - 2.5L: About 20 minutes (Approx. water level: Maximum water/the room and water temperature 20°C)
- **The range of time after boiling to the temperature of “85”**
  - 2.5L: About 50 minutes
- **The range of time after boiling to the temperature of “60”**
  - 2.5L: About 3 hours and 10 minutes (The amount of any hot water: maximum water/the room temperature: 20°C)

**NOTICE**

- Although the power cord is unplugged, the previous set temperature will not change until the temperature is adjusted next time.
- The boiling point will change upon the land level and the pressure. Then the selected warm temperature will also change. (In case the selected temperature is “98”.)
- If the room temperature is higher after the water boils, it will take more time to reach the selected temperature.
- The warming temperature can be altered although the water is being warmed. The boiling point will depend on the water temperature at that time.
- In case of using the ionized alkaline liquid, the resin will return yellow.

**NOTE**

- Do not fill the water while the water temperature is decreasing. The water may not boil when reaching the selected warm temperature.

POURING

⚠️ WARNING
Do not turn over or tilt the pot.
Do not terribly shake (especially shake up and down) or strike the pot.
Do not hold the lid while moving the pot.
The water will flow out from the water dispenser or the steam vent. Then the pot may slip and fall down, and cause some burns and injury.
[PROHIBITED symbol]

When there is very little water
Fill the water before the water reaches the water level gauge.

When not in use
Unplug the power cord and detach the lid. After that, pour out all the water.

1 Press the UNLOCK button, then the button will be unlocked.
[Diagram with UNLOCK and PUMP]
► The UNLOCK indicator will light up.
• About 2 seconds after the pot is unlocked, the water can be poured out. And 2 minutes later, the pot will be automatically locked.

2 Place the cup under the water dispenser and press the PUMP button. Then, the water will pour out.
[Diagram with UNLOCK and PUMP]
● The UNLOCK indicator will light up.
When wanting to lock right after pouring water
Press the UNLOCK button and the UNLOCK indicator will light off.

■ Regarding the prevention to warm the empty pot
To prevent the accident from overheating, if it is found that the empty pot is warmed (for example, there is the distribution of power supply when the pot is empty.), the electric current distributed to the heater will be cut off and it is noticeable from the indicator flashing.
[Diagram with indicators: REDUCE CHLORINE TIMER, WARM, BOIL, CLEAN]
Flashing
Flashing alternately
→ Please fill the water and press the [REBOIL/TEMP] button.
• If the empty pot is warmed many times, the coated fluorocarbon-resin may discolor or peel away.
