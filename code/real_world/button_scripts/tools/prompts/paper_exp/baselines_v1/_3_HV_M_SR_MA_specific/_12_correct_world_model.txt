Here is the previous version of our modelled appliance.

xxxxx 

However, we realised definition of the following variable name is wrong.

yyyyy

We updated it to be the following:

zzzzz 

If the problematic variable's value is being processed by input strings, and the updated version did not change the variable definition, then you should just modify the relevant sections in process_input_string() and get_original_input() so that our modelling matches the format shown in the appliance.

For other updated variables, the Simulator() function might contain invalid value assignment towards this variable in various actions. Can you correct them to valid value assignments and return the code for Simulator() again? Do not modify other parts, just modify Simulator() object codes involving that variable. Do not modify their reset() functions, directly copy them in your response. Only return Python code regarding Simulator(). For code given before Simulator(), such as some variable definitions and initiations, and feature_list, do not include them, as these contents will be provided.
