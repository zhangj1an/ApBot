xxxxx 

Here is an goal state of the appliance.

zzzzz 

The task instruction is as follows:

Note the definition of variable yyyyy has changed to hhhhh. Based on the task instruction, you should update the goal value of yyyyy.

rrrrr 

Please only update the relevant goal statement of yyyyy using the updated definition. Please do not change the variable name, and keep the value assignment to be consistent with the task instruction. Please only return the Python code to update the goal value of variable yyyyy and do not return other content, as I need to directly execute the python code.
