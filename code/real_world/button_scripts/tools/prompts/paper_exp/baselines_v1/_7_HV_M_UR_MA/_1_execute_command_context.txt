The user manual of the appliance is as follows:

The list of available actions of the appliance is:

The list of adjustable variables of this appliance is as follows:

yyyyy

Currently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. 

Please generate the next action to achieve the task. Then, please please decide whether it is directly adjusting the variale values from one of the listed variables above. If yes, please list the variable name and the target value of the variable. Otherwise leave these two fields empty.

When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called “press_power_button”, you can call it once by returning “run_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)”. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call “press_power_button” by 3 times, you can return “run_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)”. You can also decide to execute this action 0 times, by calling “run_action('press_power_button', execution_times=0)”. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call “run_action('press_power_button', 1)” and “run_action('press_power_button', 1)”, try to call it as “run_action('press_power_button', 2)” instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return “end” (note it should be "end", not "run_action('end')"). 

If the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. 

In particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called "press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning "run_action("press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button", execution_times=1, duration=5)". If you are not sure how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. 

Note that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.

When the action effect is to adjust a variable value, the expected feedback is target updated variable value. Note it must be a value in the given variable range in the code above. On the other hand, when the action effect is used to switch between features, there won't be any obvious feedbacks. 

You should return four Python variables: 1. variable_next_action, which is a string starts with "run_action"; 2. adjusting_variable_name, which is the name of the variable that the action is directly adjusting. If the action is not adjusting any variables, leave it empty; 3. expected_feedback, which is a target value of the adjusting_variable_name. If the action is not adjusting any variables, leave it empty. 4. reason, which is a string that explain the choice of the action. Some examples are as follows:

variable_next_action = "run_action(press_start_button', execution_times = 1)"
adjusting_variable_name = "variable_start_running"
expected_feedback = 'on'
reason = "the previous settings are done, so now we start the machine. "

or 

variable_next_action = "run_action(press_confirm_button', execution_times = 1)"
adjusting_variable_name = ""
expected_feedback = ""
reason = "now we finish setting the hour of the clock time, so need to press confirm button."

Please just return these three variables in Python, as I am going to directly eval() the responses. Each round, please only return one action, and the simulator will return the corresponding digital display. The current state of the world model will also update accordingly when the execution process progresses.

If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return "end", to save inference cost. Thanks!
