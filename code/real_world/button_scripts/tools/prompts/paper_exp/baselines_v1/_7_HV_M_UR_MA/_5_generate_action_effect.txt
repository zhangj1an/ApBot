The user manual of the appliance is as follows:

xxxxx

The list of adjustable variables of this appliance is as follows:

uuuuu

The list of available actions of the appliance is: 

hhhhh

In order to achieve the user command of:

zzzzz 

We want to set the value of variable:

yyyyy 

to 

mmmmm. 

Currently, the past actions taken are as follows: 

qqqqq

And the latest observed feedback from the appliance is as follows: 

wwwww

We want to generate a variable called action_tuples that contains a list of actions selected from the above action options that can be used to adjust variable yyyyy. The format is as follows:

There are two types of action effects: "prev" and "next", which can adjust the value of the mentioned variable to its previous or next available value. Please list in action tuples all the actions that you think can affect the value of this variable in its current situation and attach its action effects respectively. 

For example, suppose given the previous applied actions, the cooking time of a microwave can be reduced by a unit by turning the time dial anti-clockwise, and can be increased by a unit by turning the time dial clockwise. Then your response should be:

action_tuples = [("turn_time_dial_anticlockwise", "prev"), ("turn_time_dial_clockwise", "next")]

Another example, suppose pressing the power_on_off button can turn on or off the machine. Then the action_tuples = [("press_power_on_off_button", "next")]. 

If there is no suitable actions, reply action_tuples = []

Note that the same action can only have one effect, either "prev" or "next". The default effect is "next". 

Please only return the action_tuples variable in Python, as I will directly execute this response. Do not return anything else.
