Here are 20 everyday commands that you might instruct an intelligent robot to execute with a washing machine. Each command specifies the target values for the six different variables:

1. "Turn on the washing machine, choose the 'Fuzzy' program, set the wash time to 9 minutes, select rinse type '1', set spin time to 3 minutes, and water level to 35 liters."
2. "Start the washing machine, use the 'Jeans' program, adjust the wash time to 15 minutes, choose rinse type '2', set spin time to 6 minutes, and increase water level to 45 liters."
3. "Activate the washing machine, set it to the 'Delicate' program, keep the wash time at 12 minutes, use rinse type 'ex&1', set spin time at 1 minute, and use a water level of 60 liters."
4. "Power on the washing machine, opt for the 'Blanket' program, set wash time to 18 minutes, select rinse type 'ex&2', spin time 9 minutes, and use 55 liters of water."
5. "Turn the washing machine on, choose 'Wool' program, no wash time adjustment, rinse type '1', spin for 0 minutes, and set water level to 27 liters."
6. "Switch on, select 'Speedy' program, set wash to 3 minutes, no rinsing, spin time of 1 minute, water level at 20 liters."
7. "Initiate, pick 'Economy' program, wash time 6 minutes, no rinse cycles needed, do not spin, fill water to 50 liters."
8. "Engage the washing machine, choose 'Soak' program, wash time is 15 minutes, rinse type '1', set to spin for 3 minutes, water level at 30 liters."
9. "Begin with 'Tub Dry' program, wash for 18 minutes, rinse type '2', no spinning, water level 45 liters, delay wash for 3 hours."
10. "Start with 'Fuzzy' program, wash for only 3 minutes, use rinse type '2', spin for 9 minutes, max water level at 60 liters, delay by 6 hours."

11. "Switch on, use 'Jeans' setting, 9-minute wash cycle, rinse type '1', set spin to 0 minutes, and pour water to 40 liters."
12. "Activate the machine, 'Delicate' program, wash for 6 minutes, no rinse, 1-minute spin, top-up water to 35 liters."
13. "Turn on, select 'Blanket' program, wash for 12 minutes, extra rinse once, 6-minute spin, 55 liters of water."
14. "Start, 'Wool' program, no wash time, rinse twice, 3-minute spin, water level at 20."
15. "Commence 'Speedy' program, wash 15 minutes, no rinse, no spin, 27 liters of water."
16. "On, 'Economy' program, 18-minute wash, two rinses, spin off, fill 50 liters."
17. "Activate, 'Soak' program set to wash 9 minutes, no rinse needed, spin for 6 minutes, water at 47 liters."
18. "Begin with 'Tub Dry', 15-minute wash, rinse once, spin for 6 minutes, water at 45 liters, delay wash for 5 hours."
19. "Switch on, 'Fuzzy', 12-minute wash, rinse type 'ex&1', 9-minute spin, water at 60 liters."
20. "Start, 'Jeans', 18-minute wash, rinse type '2', no spin, 35 liters, delay for 9 hours."

Note: There is no explicit power on and off feature in the simulator; the assumption in these commands is built on starting with initial power on through the simulator command process.
