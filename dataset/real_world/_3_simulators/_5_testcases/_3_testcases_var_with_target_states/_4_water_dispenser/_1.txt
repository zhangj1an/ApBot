Let's analyze each command and determine the output of the `__str__` method for the appliance after executing each command. The `__str__` method outputs the current state of all variables in the appliance.

1. **Set the temperature to 98°C for boiling, then unlock the dispenser and pour some water.**

   - Set temperature to 98°C: `press_temp_clean_button` 3 times (from "0" to "60" to "85" to "98").
   - Unlock the dispenser: `press_unlock_button` once.
   - Pour water: `press_pump_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 98
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: unlocked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

2. **Adjust the water temperature to 85°C for green tea.**

   - Set temperature to 85°C: `press_temp_clean_button` 2 times (from "0" to "60" to "85").

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 85
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: locked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

3. **Select 60°C to mix milk.**

   - Set temperature to 60°C: `press_temp_clean_button` once (from "0" to "60").

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 60
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: locked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

4. **Set the dispenser to 60°C, then unlock the dispenser and pour some water.**

   - Set temperature to 60°C: `press_temp_clean_button` once (from "0" to "60").
   - Unlock the dispenser: `press_unlock_button` once.
   - Pour water: `press_pump_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 60
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: unlocked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

5. **Choose 98°C as the boiling temperature.**

   - Set temperature to 98°C: `press_temp_clean_button` 3 times (from "0" to "60" to "85" to "98").

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 98
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: locked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

6. **Set the temperature to 85°C, then unlock the dispenser and pour some water.**

   - Set temperature to 85°C: `press_temp_clean_button` 2 times (from "0" to "60" to "85").
   - Unlock the dispenser: `press_unlock_button` once.
   - Pour water: `press_pump_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 85
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: unlocked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

7. **Set water to boil at 98°C, then unlock the dispenser and pour some water.**

   - Set temperature to 98°C: `press_temp_clean_button` 3 times (from "0" to "60" to "85" to "98").
   - Unlock the dispenser: `press_unlock_button` once.
   - Pour water: `press_pump_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 98
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: unlocked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

8. **Select 60°C as the temperature, then unlock the dispenser and pour some water.**

   - Set temperature to 60°C: `press_temp_clean_button` once (from "0" to "60").
   - Unlock the dispenser: `press_unlock_button` once.
   - Pour water: `press_pump_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 60
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: unlocked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: off
   ```

9. **Enable the timer.**

   - Enable the timer: `press_reboil_timer_button` once.

   Output:
   ```
   variable_temperature_setting: 0
   variable_cleaning_mode: on
   variable_unlock_status: locked
   variable_reduce_chlorine: off
   variable_timer_setting: on
   ```

10. **Turn on the reduce chlorine feature.**

    - Turn on reduce chlorine: `press_reboil_timer_button` once.

    Output:
    ```
    variable_temperature_setting: 0
    variable_cleaning_mode: on
    variable_unlock_status: locked
    variable_reduce_chlorine: on
    variable_timer_setting: off
    ```

Note: The default state of the machine is:
```
variable_temperature_setting: 0
variable_cleaning_mode: on
variable_unlock_status: locked
variable_reduce_chlorine: off
variable_timer_setting: off
```
