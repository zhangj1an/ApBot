   - Start running: "on"
   - Cooking mode: "rice"
   - Preset time: "00:00:00"

   ```

2. **Cook brown rice and start running.**

   variable_cooking_mode: porridge
   variable_preset_time: 00:00:30
   ```

4. **Prepare yogurt and start running.**
   - The command is missing from the list, so we will skip it.

5. **Braise meat for dinner in 1 hour and start running.**
   - Start running: "on"
   - Cooking mode: "braise"
   - Preset time: "00:01:00"

   ```

6. **Make a cake for this eveningâ€™s treat and start running.**
   - Start running: "on"
   - Cooking mode: "cake"
   - Preset time: "00:00:00"

   variable_preset_time: 00:00:00
   ```

7. **Steaming vegetables for a healthy lunch and start running.**

9. **Set to multi-grain rice for a nutritious meal and start running.**

   variable_preset_time: 00:00:00
   ```

10. **Prepare yogurt and start running.**
    - The command is missing from the list, so we will skip it.

For the missing commands (4 and 10), the default machine state would be:
```
variable_start_running: off
variable_cooking_mode: rice
variable_preset_time: 00:00:00
```
Explanation: The task cannot be accomplished because the command is missing from the list.
