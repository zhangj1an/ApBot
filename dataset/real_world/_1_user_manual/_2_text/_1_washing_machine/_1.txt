**List of Programs**

- The wash time and the spin time may change during the program depending on the weight and type of laundry being washed.
- The required times are guidelines. More time may be required than is noted here depending on the water pressure and the type of laundry.
- Programs cannot be changed after they are started. To change them, turn the power off and then on again, then select a program.
- We do not recommend using fabric softener when the Water Save program is selected.
- The Water Save program cycle is the recommended program cycle for a normally soiled load of laundry at the rated capacity.
- Spin Shower Rinse* is used in the Fuzzy program to enhance water-saving performance without compromising the efficiency of rinsing.
  * Spin Shower Rinse: A powerful shower and centrifugal force rinse out detergent more effectively.
- The clear part of the lid and control panel may become foggy or may form dew on the edge of lid if you use hot water to wash your laundry, however, this is not abnormal. Wipe it off after washing your laundry.
- It has the potential not to be enough for max load according to the kind of clothes.
- Even if you set the delay timer, it may start soon according to the required time of the program.
- Water flow is adjusted automatically according to the amount of load and water level. When loads are heavy and water level are high, water flow is adjusted at slower rate to maintain the performance of washer.
- Amount of detergent is indicated according to following table as a guide.

| Load (guide) | Water Level | Detergent (guide) | Amount of detergent |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 6~7.5 kg     | 50~59 L     | 1.0~1.1 cup       | 33~39 g             |
| 4~6 kg       | 40~59 L     | 0.8~1.1 cup       | 27~39 g             |
| 2~4 kg       | 35~50 L     | 0.7~1.0 cup       | 23~33 g             |
| 0~2 kg       | 25~40 L     | 0.5~0.8 cup       | 17~27 g             |

* Detergent is based on a single 35-gram scoop of powder detergent.
The amount of detergent is based on a type of 20-gram per 30-liter.
Since the required amount of detergent varies depending on the type of detergent, follow the instructions on the package of detergent.
