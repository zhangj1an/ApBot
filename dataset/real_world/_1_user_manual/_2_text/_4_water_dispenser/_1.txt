**BOILING/POURING**

**BOILING**

Put the water in the pot and close the lid. Connect the plug. Then press the button to select the temperature.

- The BOIL indicator will light up. And after the selected TEMP indicator (‚ñº) flashes about 2 seconds, the display will light up instead.
- The display will show the raising water temperature by 5¬∞C at a time. If the temperature is lower than 15¬∞C, Lo will appear.
- The displayed temperature is as a measure. It may change depending on the amount of water or the room temperature.

**When selecting the temperature of ‚Äú98‚Äù**

- When the water boils, the BOIL indicator will light off and the WARM indicator will light up noticeably.

**When selecting the temperature of ‚Äú85‚Äù and ‚Äú60‚Äù**

- When the water boils, the BOIL indicator will light off and the selected WARM indicator will flash.
- When reaching the selected temperature, the WARM indicator will light up noticeably.

| Indication | For |
|------------|-----|
| ‚ñº 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of ‚Äú98‚Äù Coffee, Chinese tea, instant cup noodle, etc. |
| ‚ñº 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of ‚Äú85‚Äù Japanese tea, etc. |
| ‚ñº 98 85 60 CLEAN | At the temperature of ‚Äú60‚Äù Mixing milk, etc. (After melting the milk powder, let it cool down to the proper temperature.) |
| ‚ñº 98 85 60 CLEAN | (Cleaning) Refer to page 13. |

- **The time range of water boiling**
  - 2.5L: About 20 minutes (Approx. water level: Maximum water/the room and water temperature 20¬∞C)
- **The range of time after boiling to the temperature of ‚Äú85‚Äù**
  - 2.5L: About 50 minutes
- **The range of time after boiling to the temperature of ‚Äú60‚Äù**
  - 2.5L: About 3 hours and 10 minutes (The amount of any hot water: maximum water/the room temperature: 20¬∞C)

**NOTICE**

- Although the power cord is unplugged, the previous set temperature will not change until the temperature is adjusted next time.
- The boiling point will change upon the land level and the pressure. Then the selected warm temperature will also change. (In case the selected temperature is ‚Äú98‚Äù.)
- If the room temperature is higher after the water boils, it will take more time to reach the selected temperature.
- The warming temperature can be altered although the water is being warmed. The boiling point will depend on the water temperature at that time.
- In case of using the ionized alkaline liquid, the resin will return yellow.

**NOTE**

- Do not fill the water while the water temperature is decreasing. The water may not boil when reaching the selected warm temperature.

**POURING**

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**

Do not turn over or tilt the pot.  
Do not terribly shake (especially shake up and down) or strike the pot.  
Do not hold the lid while moving the pot.  
The water will flow out from the water dispenser or the steam vent. Then the pot may slip and fall down, and cause some burns and injury.  
üö´ **PROHIBITED**

**1** Press the UNLOCK button, then the button will be unlocked.

UNLOCK  
PUMP

‚ñ∫ The UNLOCK indicator will light up.  
‚Ä¢ About 2 seconds after the pot is unlocked, the water can be poured out. And 2 minutes later, the pot will be automatically locked.

**2** Place the cup under the water dispenser and press the PUMP button. Then, the water will pour out.

UNLOCK  
PUMP

‚óè The UNLOCK indicator will light up.  
When wanting to lock right after pouring water  
Press the UNLOCK button and the UNLOCK indicator will light off

**When there is very little water**

Fill the water before the water reaches the water level gauge

**When not in use**

Unplug the power cord and detach the lid. After that, pour out all the water.

‚ñ† **Regarding the prevention to warm the empty pot**

To prevent the accident from overheating, if it is found that the empty pot is warmed (for example, there is the distribution of power supply when the pot is empty.), the electric current distributed to the heater will be cut off and it is noticeable from the indicator flashing.

[Diagram with indicators: Flashing, Flashing alternately, 98, 85, 60, CLEAN, WARM, BOIL]

‚Üí Please fill the water and press the REBOIL/TEMP button.

‚Ä¢ If the empty pot is warmed many times, the coated fluorocarbon-resin may discolor or peel away.

**RREBOILING/REDUCING CHLORINE/SETTING TIMER**

**The water will be reboiled while warming.**

Press the REBOIL/TIMER button once.

Example: In case warming at the temperature of "98"

[Image of display with "98" and indicators]

- The BOIL indicator will light up.

- The time range of water reboiling
  - At the temperature of "98": About 2 - 6 min
  - At the temperature of "85": About 7 - 8 min
  - At the temperature of "60": About 12 - 14 min
  (The amount of water : maximum water/the room temperature : 20¬∞C)

**Reducing chlorine**

Press the REBOIL/TIMER button once while boiling and press it twice while warming. Then, the REDUCE CHLORINE indicator (‚ñ≤) will light up.

Example: In case of warming at the temperature of "98"

[Image of display with "98" and indicators]

- The BOIL indicator will flash and the REDUCE CHLORINE indicator (‚ñ≤) will light up.
- While the water has been boiling for 3 minutes, the amount of chlorine will be reduced.
- When the water is reboiled
  - Please press the button twice.

**SETTING TIMER**

About 6 hours after the hot water is kept at the low temperature, the pot will automatically turn to the selected temperature.
If it is applied before lunchtime or before you go out, warming the water at "98" and "85" will economize on electricity, but setting timer at the temperature of "60" cannot do.

When keeping the temperature of "98" or "85", press the REBOIL/TIMER button and the TIMER indicator (‚ñ≤) will light up.

[Image of display with "6" and indicators]

- "6" will be displayed as the hour timer and the WARM indicator will flash.
  The hours remaining until setting timer is ended will be displayed by 1 hour.
  (In case setting timer while the water is being boiled, the WARM indicator will flash after the water boils.)

After about 6 hours

[Image of display with "98" and indicators]

- The TIMER indicator (‚ñ≤) will light off and the temperature indicator will display. After that, the water will be reboiled.
  When at the selected warm temperature, the WARM indicator will light up noticeably.

- To cancel the timer

Press the REBOIL/TIMER button once.

It will switch to BOIL.

**How to clean the pot with the citric acid**

1. Put the water into the pot at the level of maximum water. Then fill about 50 grams of citric acid into the water and close the lid.

2. Connect the power cord and press the "TEMP CLEAN" button to select "CLEAN".

- The CLEAN indicator (down arrow) flashes and then lights up to start cleaning.
- It takes about 90 minutes for cleaning.

During the clean:
- EMPTY REDUCE CHLORINE TIMER
- 98 85 60 CLEAN BOIL WARM
- The WARM and BOIL indicators will flash. The remained time of the cleaning will flash in the display of minutes.

This means the pot cleaning is finished:
- EMPTY REDUCE CHLORINE TIMER
- 98 85 60 CLEAN BOIL WARM
- WARM indicator, BOIL indicator, and display will flash quickly.

3. Unplug and pour out all the water. Wipe away the dirt from the pot and wash it with water.

4. To remove the smell of the citric acid, fill the water at the level of maximum water and select the temperature of ‚Äú98‚Äù. After that, boil the water and then pour out all the boiled water.

**NOTICE**
After finishing cleaning the pot with the citric acid, unplug. When connect the power cord next time, it means cleaning the citric acid. Before disconnecting the power cord, always press the "TEMP CLEAN" button and select the temperature of ‚Äú98‚Äù.
