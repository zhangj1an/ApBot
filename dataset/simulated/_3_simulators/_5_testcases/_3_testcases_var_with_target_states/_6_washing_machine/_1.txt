Let's go through each command and determine the output of the `__str__` method for the appliance after executing each command.

1. **Command**: Wash cotton bed linen for a baby, using cotton cycle, 30 °C temperature, 800 rpm spin speed, prewash option, set delay to 5 hours, and start the machine.
   - **Output**:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: off
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_cycle_selector: Cotton
     variable_temperature: 0
     variable_spin_speed: 0
     variable_option: off
     variable_delay_end: 0
