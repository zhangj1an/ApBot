To determine the output of the `__str__` method after executing each command, we need to understand the sequence of actions required to achieve the desired state for each command. The `__str__` method will output the current state of the appliance's variables. Let's analyze each command:

1. **Turn on the rice cooker and select the "WHITE RICE" function with a reservation timer set for 4 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "WHITE RICE"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 4 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: WHITE RICE
     variable_delay_timer: 4
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

2. **Power on the rice cooker and choose "BROWN" rice mode with a reservation timer set for 5 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "BROWN"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 5 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: BROWN
     variable_delay_timer: 5
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

3. **Activate the rice cooker and cook "PORRIDGE" with a reserved start time of 1 hour from now.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "PORRIDGE"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 1 hour).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: PORRIDGE
     variable_delay_timer: 1
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

4. **Start the rice cooker and prepare "GRAINS" with a reservation timer set for 2 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "GRAINS"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 2 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: GRAINS
     variable_delay_timer: 2
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

5. **Power on the rice cooker and set it to cook "MIXED" rice with a reservation timer set for 6 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "MIXED"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 6 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: MIXED
     variable_delay_timer: 6
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

6. **Turn on the rice cooker, schedule "STEAM" function to finish in 5 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "STEAM"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 5 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: STEAM
     variable_delay_timer: 5
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

7. **Power on the rice cooker and choose "SOUP", set it to start cooking in 3 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "SOUP"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 3 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: SOUP
     variable_delay_timer: 3
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

8. **Enable the rice cooker to cook "STEW" with a reservation timer set for 4 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "STEW"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 4 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: STEW
     variable_delay_timer: 4
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

9. **Activate the rice cooker, and set "WHITE RICE" with a delayed start time of 6 hours.**
   - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "WHITE RICE"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 6 hours).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_start_running: off
     variable_menu_index: WHITE RICE
     variable_delay_timer: 6
     variable_quick_rice: off
     variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
     ```

10. **Power on and reserve "BROWN" rice cooking to begin in 7 hours.**
    - Actions: `press_menu_button` (to select "BROWN"), `press_delay_button` (to set timer to 7 hours).
    - Output:
      ```
      variable_start_running: off
      variable_menu_index: BROWN
      variable_delay_timer: 7
      variable_quick_rice: off
      variable_keep_warm_cancel: off
      ```

In each case, the `variable_start_running` remains "off" because the `press_start_button` is not executed in any of the commands.
