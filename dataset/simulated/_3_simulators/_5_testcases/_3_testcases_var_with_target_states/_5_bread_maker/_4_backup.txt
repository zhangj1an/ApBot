To determine the output of the `__str__` method after executing each command, we need to analyze the simulator code and the commands. The `__str__` method returns the current state of the appliance, which includes the values of all the variables. Let's go through each command:

1. **Command 1**: 
   - Menu: Basic (1)
   - Crust: Light
   - Loaf Size: 450g
   - Timer: 1-hour delay
   - Gluten-Free: On
   - Start: On

   The appliance will be set to:
   ```
   variable_menu_index: 1
   variable_crust_colour: Light
   variable_loaf_size: 450g
   variable_gluten_free: on
   variable_timer: 01:00:00
   variable_start_running: on
   ```
