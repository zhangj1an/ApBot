To determine the output of the `__str__` method after executing each command, we need to understand the initial state of the appliance and how each command affects it. The initial state of the appliance is:

- Power: off
- Cool Mode Temperature: 0°C
- Fan Speed: HIGH
- Operating Mode: COOL
- Timer: 0 hours

Let's analyze each command:

1. **"Power on the dehumidifier and adjust the fan speed to HIGH."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Fan speed is already HIGH.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

2. **"Switch on the dehumidifier and set the programmable timer to 3 hours."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Timer is set to 3 hours.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 3
     ```

3. **"Turn on the dehumidifier and set it to DRY Mode."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Operating mode is set to DRY.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: DRY
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

4. **"Power on the dehumidifier and set the temperature to 30°C in Cool Mode."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Operating mode is set to COOL (if not already).
   - Temperature is set to 30°C.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 30
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

5. **"Switch on the dehumidifier and change the fan speed to LOW."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Fan speed is set to LOW.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: LOW
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

6. **"Activate the dehumidifier and set the programmable timer to 8 hours."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Timer is set to 8 hours.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 8
     ```

7. **"Turn on the dehumidifier and set the operating mode to SMART."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Operating mode is set to SMART.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: SMART
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

8. **"Power on the dehumidifier and set the temperature to 24°C in Cool Mode."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Operating mode is set to COOL (if not already).
   - Temperature is set to 24°C.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 24
     variable_fan_speed: HIGH
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

9. **"Switch on the dehumidifier and adjust the fan speed to AUTO."**
   - Power is turned on.
   - Fan speed is set to AUTO.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
     variable_fan_speed: AUTO
     variable_operating_mode: COOL
     variable_timer: 0
     ```

10. **"Start the dehumidifier and set the programmable timer to 12 hours."**
    - Power is turned on.
    - Timer is set to 12 hours.
    - Output:
      ```
      variable_power_on_off: on
      variable_cool_mode_temperature: 0
      variable_fan_speed: HIGH
      variable_operating_mode: COOL
      variable_timer: 12
      ```

Each command is executed independently, and the appliance is reset to its initial state before each command.
