Let's evaluate the output of the `__str__` method for each command based on the provided simulator code:

1. **Turn on the machine and set it to automatic sterilize and dry for 30 minutes.**
   - The machine is initially off. We need to turn it on and set it to automatic sterilize and dry for 30 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 30).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 30
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

2. **Power on the device and initiate a 45-minute automatic sterilize and dry cycle.**
   - Similar to command 1, but set drying time to 45 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 45).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 45
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

3. **Switch on the appliance and run a 60-minute automatic sterilize and dry program.**
   - Similar to command 1, but set drying time to 60 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 60).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 60
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

4. **Turn on the machine and start the sterilize-only function.**
   - Turn on the machine and start the sterilize-only function.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_sterilize_only_button`.
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 0
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

5. **Activate the device and initiate the dry-only function for 30 minutes.**
   - Turn on the machine and set it to dry-only for 30 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_dry_only_button` (to set drying cycle to 30).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 0
     variable_sterilization_cycle: 0
     variable_drying_cycle: 30
     ```

6. **Power on the appliance and set it to dry-only mode for 45 minutes.**
   - Similar to command 5, but set drying cycle to 45 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_dry_only_button` (to set drying cycle to 45).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 0
     variable_sterilization_cycle: 0
     variable_drying_cycle: 45
     ```

7. **Turn on the unit and operate the dry-only feature for 60 minutes.**
   - Similar to command 5, but set drying cycle to 60 minutes.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_dry_only_button` (to set drying cycle to 60).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 0
     variable_sterilization_cycle: 0
     variable_drying_cycle: 60
     ```

8. **Power up the machine and perform automatic sterilize and dry for 30 minutes, assuming the bottles are for an infant.**
   - The additional condition about infant bottles does not affect the machine's state.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 30).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 30
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

9. **Switch on the device and commence a 45-minute automatic sterilize and dry cycle, ensuring pet-safe use.**
   - The additional condition about pet-safe use does not affect the machine's state.
   - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 45).
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_on_off: on
     variable_drying_time: 45
     variable_sterilization_cycle: running
     variable_drying_cycle: 0
     ```

10. **Activate the appliance and opt for a 60-minute automatic sterilize and dry run, considering cold weather conditions.**
    - The additional condition about cold weather does not affect the machine's state.
    - Actions: `press_on_off_button`, `press_automatic_sterilize_dry_button` (to set drying time to 60).
    - Output:
      ```
      variable_on_off: on
      variable_drying_time: 60
      variable_sterilization_cycle: running
      variable_drying_cycle: 0
      ```

In each case, the machine is turned on, and the appropriate function is set according to the command. The additional conditions in commands 8, 9, and 10 do not affect the machine's state as per the provided simulator code.
