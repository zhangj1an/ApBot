Let's go through each command and determine the output of the `__str__` method for the appliance after executing each command:

1. **Turn on the bottle washer and set it to "Wash & Dry" mode, and press start to begin.**
   - Turn on the appliance: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Set to "Wash & Dry" mode: `variable_wash_mode` is already "Wash & Dry".
   - Press start: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash & Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Sterilize & Dry
     variable_start_running: on
     ```

   - Activate the appliance: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Run "Sterilize & Dry" cycle: `variable_sterilize_dry_mode` is already "Sterilize & Dry".
   - Press start: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash & Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Sterilize & Dry
     variable_start_running: on
     ```

5. **Turn on the machine and choose the "Dry Only" mode to dry a washed bottle, and press start to begin.**
   - Turn on the machine: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Choose "Dry Only" mode: `variable_sterilize_dry_mode` changes from "Sterilize & Dry" to "Dry Only".
   - Press start: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash & Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Dry Only
     variable_start_running: on
     ```

6. **Turn on the appliance and set it to "Sterilize Only" mode for a single bottle, and press start to begin.**
   - Turn on the appliance: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Set to "Sterilize Only" mode: `variable_sterilize_dry_mode` changes from "Sterilize & Dry" to "Sterilize Only".
   - Press start: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash & Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Sterilize Only

     ```

7. **Power on the bottle washer, choose "Wash & Dry", and start the cycle.**
   - Power on the appliance: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Choose "Wash & Dry": `variable_wash_mode` is already "Wash & Dry".
   - Start the cycle: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash & Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Sterilize & Dry
     variable_start_running: on
     ```

8. **Switch on, select "Wash, Sterilize, Dry", and begin the washing procedure.**
   - Switch on the appliance: `variable_power_on_off` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Select "Wash, Sterilize, Dry": `variable_wash_mode` changes from "Wash & Dry" to "Wash, Sterilize, Dry".
   - Begin the washing procedure: `variable_start_running` changes from "off" to "on".
   - Output:
     ```
     variable_power_on_off: on
     variable_wash_mode: Wash, Sterilize, Dry
     variable_sterilize_dry_mode: Sterilize & Dry
     variable_start_running: on
     ```

9. **Turn on the appliance, set "Wash Only" mode, and initiate the cleaning cycle.**

      ```

In each case, the appliance is turned on, the appropriate mode is selected, and the cycle is started. If a task cannot be accomplished due to a missing feature or incorrect sequence, the default machine state would be shown, but in this case, all tasks can be accomplished.
