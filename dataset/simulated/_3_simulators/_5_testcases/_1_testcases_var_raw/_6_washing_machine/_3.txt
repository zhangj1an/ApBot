Here are twenty different everyday commands for an intelligent robot to operate a washing machine. Each command specifies target values for six variables: power state, program selection, water level, and preset time. Since the washing machine only has these four adjustable variables, I'll include a note indicating that the total number of variables is less than six:

1. "Turn on the washing machine, select the Normal program for everyday clothes, set the water level to 55 L, and start immediately."

2. "Turn on the washing machine, choose the Delicate program for gentle washing, set the water level to 42 L, and finish in 4 hours."

3. "Power on the washing machine, select the Baby-care program for baby clothes, set the water level to 37 L, and finish in 6 hours."

4. "Switch the washing machine on, use the Fragrance program for extra softener, set the water level to 32 L, and finish in 3 hours."

5. "Turn the washing machine on, set the Blanket program for washing blankets, choose a water level of 29 L, and start immediately."

6. "Activate the washing machine, pick the Soak program for heavily soiled clothes, set the water level to 20 L, and finish in 8 hours."

7. "Turn on the washer, select the Energy Save program for saving time, set the water level to 55 L, and start immediately."

8. "Power on the washing machine, choose the Water Save program to conserve water, set the water level to 42 L, and finish in 5 hours."

9. "Switch on the washing machine, opt for the Air Dry program for drying synthetic clothes, set the water level to 32 L, and finish in 7 hours."

10. "Turn the washer on, choose Tub Hygiene for maintenance, set the water level to 37 L, and start immediately."

11. "Power on the washing machine, set the Normal program, select a water level of 20 L, and finish in 9 hours."

12. "Switch on the washer, select the Delicate program, choose a water level of 55 L, start immediately."

13. "Turn on the machine, select Baby-care program, set a water level of 42 L, and finish in 2 hours."

14. "Activate the washing machine, choose the Fragrance program, select a 32 L water level, and start immediately."

15. "Power on the washer, set to Blanket program, choose a water level of 29 L, finish in 10 hours."

16. "Turn the washing machine on, use the Soak program, set the water level to 37 L, and finish in 12 hours."

17. "Switch on the washing machine, use the Energy Save program, set a water level of 20 L, start immediately."

18. "Activate the washing machine, choose Water Save program, set the water level to 55 L, finish in 11 hours."

19. "Power the washing machine on, select Air Dry program, choose 42 L water level, and start immediately."

20. "Turn on the washer, select the Tub Hygiene, set a water level of 37 L, and finish in 13 hours."
