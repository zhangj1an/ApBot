1. Turn on the rice cooker and select the "WHITE RICE" function. Start cooking immediately with no delay (`variable_menu_index: WHITE RICE`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

2. Power on the rice cooker and choose "BROWN" rice mode. Start cooking immediately with no delay (`variable_menu_index: BROWN`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

3. Activate the rice cooker and cook "PORRIDGE" with a reserved start time of 1 hour from now (`variable_menu_index: PORRIDGE`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 01:00:00`).

4. Start the rice cooker and prepare "GRAINS" with a reservation timer set for 2 hours and 30 minutes (`variable_menu_index: GRAINS`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 02:30:00`).

5. Power on the rice cooker and set it to cook "MIXED" rice immediately (`variable_menu_index: MIXED`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

6. Turn on the rice cooker, schedule "STEAM" function to finish in 5 hours (`variable_menu_index: STEAM`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 05:00:00`).

7. Power on the rice cooker and choose "SOUP", set it to start cooking in 3 hours (`variable_menu_index: SOUP`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 03:00:00`).

8. Enable the rice cooker to cook "STEW" immediately with no waiting time (`variable_menu_index: STEW`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

9. Start the rice cooker in "QUICK RICE" mode for an immediate 30-minute cook (`variable_quick_rice: on`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

10. Activate the rice cooker, and set "WHITE RICE" with a delayed start time of 4 hours (`variable_menu_index: WHITE RICE`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 04:00:00`).

11. Power on and reserve "BROWN" rice cooking to begin in 6 hours (`variable_menu_index: BROWN`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 06:00:00`).

12. Turn on the rice cooker for "PORRIDGE", scheduled to start in less than 3 hours, ensuring it aligns with cooking time limitations (`variable_menu_index: PORRIDGE`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 02:59:00`).

13. Enable the rice cooker and set "GRAINS" to start cooking in exactly 7 hours (`variable_menu_index: GRAINS`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 07:00:00`).

14. Set the cooker to "MIXED", to begin cooking in 8 hours (`variable_menu_index: MIXED`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 08:00:00`).

15. Turn on the rice cooker for a "STEAM" function on a 9-hour delay (`variable_menu_index: STEAM`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 09:00:00`).

16. Activate the rice cooker and select "SOUP", set to cook in 10-hour delay timeframe (`variable_menu_index: SOUP`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 10:00:00`).

17. Start the rice cooker with "STEW" function, using exact time delay of 11 hours (`variable_menu_index: STEW`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 11:00:00`).

18. Power on and choose "QUICK RICE", to start promptly without any delay time (`variable_quick_rice: on`, `variable_start_running: on`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`).

19. Activate the rice cooker and press "KEEP WARM" function immediately (`variable_keep_warm_cancel: on`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`). Note: The total number of variables is less than 3.

20. Turn on the rice cooker, schedule it to "CANCEL" ongoing function after immediate activation (`variable_keep_warm_cancel: off`, `variable_start_running: off`, `variable_delay_timer: 00:00:00`). Note: The total number of variables is less than 3.
