**BEFORE FIRST USE**

1. Before using your toaster oven for the first time, carefully remove all packaging materials and recycle appropriately.
2. Remove the parts from the box and wash all removable parts with warm, soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge.
3. Place the appliance on a flat, horizontal and stable surface (make sure surface is heat-resistant).
4. Turn on the upper and lower heating elements at 450°F for 15 minutes (with the oven empty) to eliminate any factory residue. This may result in minimal smoke, that is normal and harmless.

**HOW TO USE**

**BROIL**

1. Set the upper heating element to desired temperature. We do not recommend using convection when broiling.
2. Prepare the food per recipe instructions and place on the baking tray or another broiler-safe pan. Insert the baking tray (or removable rack) in the highest position possible (so the food is close to, but not touching the upper elements).
3. Close glass doors completely.
4. Turn the timer knob to 20.  
   **NOTE:** If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20 minute mark to engage the timer then back to desired time.
5. When cooking time has elapsed, bell indicator will sound. Turn the upper element to OFF. Remove food carefully.

**CAUTION:**

- DO NOT IMMERSE THE BODY OF THE UNIT IN WATER.
- When oven is in use or cooling down, please be sure there is 6-inches of clearance between the oven and any other surface including cords. Be sure the cord is not resting against the back of the oven.

**TIP:**

Timer Dial must always be set to a desired time to begin heating.

**WARNING:**

Cooked food and metal rack can be very hot, handle with care. Do not leave countertop oven unattended.

Cooking results may vary. Adjust these times to your individual requirements.  
Use of a meat thermostat is recommended.

|-------------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Rib Steak         | 450°F      | 20 - 30 min               | 135°F - 160°F   |

| Pork Chops        | 400°F      | 40 - 45 min               | 145°F           |
| Lamb Chops        | 400°F      | 30 - 40 min               | 145°F           |
| Chicken Legs      | 400°F      | 30 - 35 min               | 165°F           |

**BAKE**
1. Set the upper and lower heating elements to 350°F. Cooking with convection is not recommended when baking cakes or breads. We do recommend using convection when roasting meats or vegetables.
2. Place a removable rack in the desired position.
3. Insert your food on/in an oven-safe pan.
4. Close glass doors completely.
5. Turn the timer knob to the desired cooking time per your recipe.  
   **NOTE:** If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20 minute mark to engage the timer then back to desired time.
6. When cooking time has elapsed, bell indicator will sound. Turn both elements OFF, turn function (if used) to OFF. Remove food carefully.

**Suggested Position of the Baking Tray While Baking**
- Cookies: Use bottom and middle support guides.
- Layer Cakes: Use bottom support guides only (bake one at a time).
- Pies: Use bottom or middle support guides.

**For Cooking Two Pizzas**
1. Place the 2 pizzas on the wire racks.
2. Cook the pizzas for about one-half the recommended time, and then switch the rack positions to allow the pizzas to uniformly cook top and bottom.

**HOW TO USE (cont.)**

**TOAST**
1. Set the upper and lower heating elements to 450°F. Use convection if desired.
2. Place a removable rack into the desired position.
3. Place food to be toasted on the rack.
4. Close glass doors completely.
5. Turn the timer knob to the desired cooking time.
   **NOTE:** If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20 minute mark to engage the timer then back to desired time.
6. When cooking time has elapsed, bell indicator will sound. Turn both elements OFF, turn function (if used) to OFF. Remove food carefully.

**TOASTING GUIDE:**

| TOAST SHADE | OVEN TEMP. | TIME    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Light       | 450°F      | 2-3 min |
| Medium      | 450°F      | 4-5 min |
| Dark        | 450°F      | 6-7 min |

**CONVECTION**
1. Set the function dial to convection.
2. Use convection with the upper element, the lower element, or both.
3. Set the desired temperature and timer per your recipe. The fan circulates the air in the oven, but it runs very quietly (you'll only hear a faint hum).
4. **When to use:** convection will give you uniform browning, and will brown foods faster. We recommend using convection when roasting, toasting, or cooking anything with a cover.
5. **When not to use:** convection should not be used when baking cakes, bread, or anything that needs to rise; do not use with foods that easily dry out.
6. When cooking time has elapsed, bell indicator will sound. Turn the elements to OFF, turn function to OFF. Remove food carefully.

**WARNING:**
Cooked food and metal rack can be very hot, handle with care. Do not leave countertop oven unattended.

**NOTE:**
Since convection will cook foods faster, remember to adjust your recipes (lower temperature or shorten the cooking time) and watch cooking closely.

**HOW TO USE (cont.)**

**ROTISSERIE OR CONVECTION ROTISSERIE**

1. Set the upper heating element to desired temperature. Set the function dial to rotisserie or convection rotisserie.
2. Insert the bake tray in the lowest position in the oven to catch the drippings.
3. Insert one prong onto the rod, pointing inward. Secure with thumbscrew.
4. Load the food on the rod, ensuring it is centered, and secure the second prong with the thumbscrew. **Maximum food weight is 7.0 lbs.**
5. Using the rotisserie tool, insert the pointed end of the rod into the drive socket on the right (you may have to twist the rod to align with the socket), then rest the square end of the rod on the support on the left.
6. Close glass doors completely.
7. Turn the timer knob to your desired cooking time per your recipe. If food does not rotate smoothly, stop, remove, and secure/balance the food. Restart. **NOTE:** If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20 minute mark to engage the timer then back to desired time.
8. When cooking time has elapsed, bell indicator will sound. Turn the upper element to OFF, turn function to OFF.
9. To remove the food, lift the food out with the rotisserie tool. Lift the left side up from the support first, then remove the right end from the socket.
10. Place the food on a cutting board or plate and carefully remove the hot rotisserie prongs and rod. Let rest 5-10 minutes before serving.

**NOTE:**
We recommend tying the food with butcher’s twine to keep it secure while on the rotisserie.

**WARNING:**
Cooked food and metal rack can be very hot, handle with care. Do not leave countertop oven unattended.
