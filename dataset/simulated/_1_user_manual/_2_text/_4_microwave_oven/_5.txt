**ROTISSERIE USE**

1. Leave the door at the open point.

4. Put the other skewer through the pointed end of the spit, and slide the skewer towards the square end of the spit.
5. Put the two skewers into the food, and secure both skewers with the thumb screws.
6. Make sure the food is centered horizontally on the spit.
7. Insert the pointed end of the spit into the drive socket, making sure the square end of the spit rests on the spit support.
8. Plug the power cable to the electric mains and switch it ON.
9. Turn the Temperature dial clockwise to 250°C.
10. Turn the Function dial clockwise to the desired operation: Rotisserie or Rotisserie & Convection.
11. Turn the Selector dial clockwise to select top heating, bottom heating or both.
12. Turn the Timer dial clockwise to the desired cooking duration. Heating will commence immediately.
13. The power light will light up after timer is turned on, and will go out when the timer is turned to OFF. (Normally it takes 30 minutes to roast a 2.5 kg / 5.5 lbs chicken).

Lift the right side of the spit first, move it a fraction to the right, so that the left side of the spit can exit the drive socket. Then carefully move the roasted food out of the oven. Beware NOT to touch the food as it is extremely hot at this moment.
