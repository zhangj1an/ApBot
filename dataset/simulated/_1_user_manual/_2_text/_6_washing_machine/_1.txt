It takes a minimum of about 15 minutes, but can vary from the indicated values depending on the water pressure, water hardness, water inlet temperature, room temperature, type and amount of washing and degree of soiling, utilized detergent unbalanced load, fluctuation in the electricity supply and any extra options selected. [Caution symbol] CAUTION: There should be less than 20 g of detergent (for 2 kg load) or detergent may remain on the clothes. |

| Stain Away     | For stained clothing. The Stain Away cycle provides outstanding stain removal performance of the utmost care, avoiding the need for the pre-treatment of stains. For the best stain removal performance, we recommend using the hot temperature option in this cycle, where the wash temperature is increased using the internal heater for the overall cleaning of a wide variety of stains. This cycle includes a soaking action that removes stains from your laundry effectively. During the soaking action, the drum stops rotating for a while, and this is not a malfunction. |

| Outdoor Care   | For water-proof items such as mountain clothing, skiwear, and sportswear. Fabrics include functional technology finishes and fibres such as spandex, stretch, and micro-fibre.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Wool           | Only for machine-washable wool. A load should be less than 2.0 kg. (6 kg-class model: 1.5 kg) The Wool cycle washes the laundry using a gentle cradling action. During the wash cycle, the gentle cradling and soaking actions are continued to protect the wool fibres from shrinkage/distortion and for a super gentle clean. This stop/start operation by the washing machine during the soaking action is not a malfunction. A neutral detergent is recommended for the Wool cycle, for improved washing results and for improved care of the wool fibres. |
| Hand Wash      | A very light wash cycle as gentle as a hand wash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Spin           | Performs an additional spin cycle to remove more water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Rinse+Spin     | For a load that only needs rinsing or to add a rinse-added fabric softener to a load.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

# Laundry guidelines

Follow these simple guidelines for the cleanest laundry and the most efficient wash.

- Always check the care label on clothing before washing.

# Sort and wash your laundry according to the following criteria:

- Care Label: Sort laundry into cottons, mixed fibres, synthetics, silks, wools and rayons.
- Colour: Divide whites and colours. Wash colour items separately.
- Size: Placing items of different sizes in the same load will improve the wash action.
- Sensitivity: Wash delicate items separately using a delicate wash cycle for pure, new woollen items, curtains and silk articles. Check the labels on the items you are washing or refer to the "Fabric care chart" section on page 37.

# Emptying pockets

Before each wash, empty all the pockets of your laundry items. Small, irregularly shaped hard objects, such as coins, knives, pins, and paperclips can damage your washing machine.

Do not wash clothing with large buckles, buttons, or other heavy metal objects. Metal on clothing may damage your clothing as well as the drum. Turn clothing with buttons and embroidered clothes inside out before washing them. If zips of pants and jackets are open while washing, the drum may be damaged. Zips should be closed and fixed with a string before washing.

Clothing with long strings may become entangled with other clothes damaging them. Be sure to fix the strings before starting the wash.

# Prewashing cotton

Your new washing machine, combined with modern detergents, will give perfect washing results, saving you energy, time, water and detergent. However, if your cotton is particularly dirty, perform a prewash cycle with a protein-based detergent.
