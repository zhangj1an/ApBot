SET UP & USE

⚠️ WARNING

To reduce the risk of electric shock, or injury to persons, read the important safety instructions before operating this appliance.

WASHING A LOAD OF LAUNDRY

⚠️ Operate with cold water only.

Step 1: Power on your washer

⏻ Press the ON/OFF button to power your wash on.

Step 2: Load your washer

⚠️ Before loading your laundry, be sure to take out coins, keys and other hard objects, and close all zippers to prevent the clothes from damage.

Sort laundry by fabric type, soil level, color and load size as needed. Refer to the Fabric Care Chart in the APPENDIX. You can fill the tub with dry, unfolded clothes, but DO NOT OVERLOAD the tub. Load the tub no more than 3/4 full.

To ensure good cleaning results do not overload the tub, especially when washing heavily soiled loads. Never load the tub more than 3/4 full.

⚠️ Overloading may reduce washing efficiency, cause excess wear, and possibly cause creasing or wrinkling of items in the load.

NOTE: To add a forgotten item:
1. Press the START/PAUSE button to pause the washer.
2. Wait for the tub to stop turning, then open the door.
3. Add the item, close the door, and then press the START PAUSE button. The cycle will resume.

Step 3: Add detergent

This washer is designed for high efficiency (HE) detergent only. Add the recommended amount of detergent directly into basket before starting your washer. The normal amount of detergent to use is 1/4 to 1/2 of the maximum amount recommended by the detergent manufacturer. Always reduce the amount of detergent if the load is small or lightly soiled, or if your water is very soft. Never use more than the maximum amount recommended by the detergent manufacturer.

⚠️ Never pour any liquid bleach directly onto the load. It can cause fabric damage, such as weakening of cloth fibers or color loss.
