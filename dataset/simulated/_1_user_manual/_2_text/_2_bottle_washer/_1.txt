- Mineral residue, particularly in hard water areas, may deposit on the stainless steel heating plate after a few sterilization cycles. To avoid scale build up, wipe the surfaces with a soft moist cloth after each operation.
- Deposits can be removed with scale removers or by leaving 60ml/2oz water and vinegar solution (50/50 water & vinegar mix) on the heating plate for approximately 30 minutes. The plate should then be wiped clean with a clean, dry cloth. Some discoloration spots may remain after cleaning with a vinegar solution, but these are harmless.
