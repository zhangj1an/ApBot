**Tips for best use**

- Always load nipples facing up so water does not collect inside.
- When placing bottles, accessories or other items in the washer, make sure that water can run off the items and will not collect in product indentations. Example: don’t place bottles or cups right side up or they will fill with water.
- Some bottles have concave bases which will collect water. It is normal to see a small amount of water on the bottom of bottles even after drying. You can tilt the bottle so the water runs off in the Bottle Washer Pro® and let air dry.
- Some nipples may collect water around the outside flange and will not dry completely. You can tilt them so the water runs off and let air dry.
- Always use Baby Brezza detergent tablets - see page 6 and visit babybrezza.com for more info.
- **DO NOT USE any type of liquid, powder or pod detergent for your household dishwasher. These detergents are not properly sized or configured for the Bottle Washer Pro and will create too much foam and leave detergent residue on your products**
- If you need to discharge all water from the sump, press and hold the “Wash Mode” and “Sterilize/Dry” buttons for 3 seconds and the discharge pump will pump water from the sump to the waste water tank.
