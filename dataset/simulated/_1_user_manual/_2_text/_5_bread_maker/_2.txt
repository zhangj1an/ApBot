Program descriptions

1 Basic white (3:00 and 2:53)
For white and brown bread. Also for flavoured breads with added herbs and raisin.

2 French (3:50 and 3:40)
For the baking of light weight bread such as french bread which has a crisper crust and light texture.

3 Wholewheat (3:40 and 3:32)
For the baking of bread containing significant amounts of wholewheat. This setting has longer preheat time to allow the grain to soak up the water and expand. It is not advised to use the delay timer as this can produce poor results.

4 Quick (1:40)
For white bread that is required in a shorter time. Bread baked on this setting is usually smaller with a dense texture.

5 Sweet (2:55 and 2:50)
For the baking of sweet type bread which gives a crisper crust than on basic setting. The crisper crust is produced by the sugar ‘burning’.

6 Fastbake I (0:58)
For preparation of a 1.5lb white loaf in a reduced time period. Loaves made on this setting can be shorter and the texture more moist.

7 Fastbake II (0:58)
For preparation of a 2lb white loaf in a reduced time period. Loaves made on this setting can be shorter and the texture more moist.

8 Dough (1:30)
This setting only makes the dough and will not bake the final bread. Remove the dough and shape it to make bread rolls, pizza, etc. Any dough can be prepared on this setting. Do not exceed 1kg (2lb) of combined ingredients.

9 Jam (1:20)
Use this setting for making jam from fresh fruits and marmalade from Seville oranges. Do not increase the quantity or allow the recipe to boil over the pan into the baking chamber. Should this happen, stop the machine immediately. Remove the pan carefully, allow to cool a little and clean thoroughly.

10 Cake (2:50)
This setting will mix ingredients and then bake for a preset time. It is required to mix two groups of ingredients in bowls before adding to the breadmaker (see cake recipes).

11 Sandwich (3:00 and 2:55)
This is to bake light texture bread but with a softer but thicker crust.

12 Extra bake (1:00)
This setting is bake only and can be used to increase the baking time on selected settings. This is especially useful to help ‘set’ jams and marmalade. When started the default time is 1 hour (1:00) minimum and counts down in 10 minute intervals. You will have to manually switch this off by pressing the stop button, when you have completed the Extrabake process. It is advised that you check the condition of the bread or jam after 10 minutes and at 10 minute intervals. Pressing up arrow increases the time in increments of 10 minutes.
When selecting Extrabake straight after another program, if the message H:HH is displayed, open the lid, remove the pan and allow to cool for 10 minutes. When cool, replace the baking pan and its contents, set program and press start.

**Using your breadmaker**

1. **Take out the pan**  
   Open the lid and remove the pan by lifting the handle, turning anti-clockwise and lifting out. Place on the work surface. It is important that the pan is filled with ingredients outside the machine so that any accidental spillage is not ignited by the heating elements.

2. **Attach the blade**  
   Attach the kneading blade to the shaft by pushing on.

3. **Measure ingredients**  
   Measure the ingredients required and add them all into the pan in the order listed. See later section ‘Measuring your ingredients’.  
   - When adding the yeast to the baking pan, take care that the yeast does not come into contact with the water or any other liquid, as it will start to activate immediately.  
   - Use tepid water 21-28°C.

4. **Put pan back in**  
   Place the baking pan back in the breadmaker, turning clockwise to lock into place. Close the lid.

5. **Plug in**  
   Plug into the power supply. The breadmaker will automatically be set to basic bread menu and normal time.  
   - Every time you press a button you will hear a beep to confirm.

6. **Select program**  
   Choose the desired setting from the list by pressing the Menu button.

7. **Select weight**  
   Press Loaf size button to choose between small or large.

8. **Select colour**  
   Choose desired crust colour by pressing Colour button.

9. **Select the delay time**  
   If you wish the bread to be ready later, set the time delay now, as described in next section.

10. **Start**  
    Press the Start Stop button to start the machine. The remaining time will count down in one minute increments.

11. **Progress**  
    The breadmaker will automatically proceed through the programmed stages as shown in the ‘Baking cycle times’ section. If the breadmaker has a program selected that has a second kneading process, beeps sound to inform that fruits and/or nuts may be added.  
    - It is possible that steam will escape through the vents during baking, this is normal.

12. **Finish**  
    When the program is completed and the bread is baked the display shows 0:00 and the beeper will sound.

13. **Keep warm**  
    The keep warm function will circulate hot air for a further 60 minutes on most settings (see ‘Baking cycle times’ section). For best results, remove the baking pan and loaf within this period or when the initial program is completed. 10 beeps will be heard when the keep warm period is finished.

14. **Remove the food**  
    Press Stop. Open the lid.  
    **WARNING:** Use oven gloves when removing the baking pan (taking care as it is very hot).

15. **Turn out the bread**  
    Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then turn the pan upside down and tap the bread from the pan onto a rack to cool. Fill the pan with warm water immediately to prevent the blade from sticking to the shaft.  
    - Occasionally the kneading blade will stay in the loaf. Wait until the loaf is cool and then remove the blade with a wooden or plastic utensil to avoid damage to the non-stick surface.

16. **Always unplug the appliance after use.**

    - Do not open the lid whilst the breadmaker is operating as this will affect the quality of the bread, especially its ability to rise properly. Only open the lid when the recipe needs you to add additional ingredients, see recipes.

**Room temperature note**  
The breadmaker will work well in a wide range of temperatures, but there could be a difference in loaf size between a very warm room and a very cold room. We recommend the room temperature should be between 15°C and 34°C.

**Using the timer**

Use the timer when you want the bread ready later, or in the morning. A maximum of 13 hours can be set. Check if function is available by consulting ‘Baking cycle times’ section. Do not use this function with recipes that use perishable ingredients such as eggs, fresh milk, sour cream, or cheese.

1. Decide when you want the bread to be ready and calculate the difference in time between now and then. For example, if you want a loaf at 8am, and it is now 7.30pm, the difference is 12 1/2 hours.
2. Enter this time by pressing ‘Time ▼’ and ‘Time ▲’ buttons. Arrows will move time up or down in 10-minute increments. After you have pressed Start, the colon (:) will flash.
   - If you have selected the wrong time press stop for 2 seconds. The timer will go back to the program time, repeat step 1 and 2.
3. The timer delay is up to a maximum of 13 hours. This is when the bread will be ready to remove from the machine, see page 8 item 14 ‘Remove the food’.

**Beeper**

- The beeper sounds:
  - when pressing any button;
  - during the second kneading cycle of certain programs to indicate that cereals, fruit, nuts or other ingredients can be added;
  - when the program finishes;
  - when keep warm finishes.

**Power interruption**

After a brief power supply failure
- if the program has not yet reached rise 1, press Start and the program will continue using the automatic repeat function;
- if it has gone beyond this point, the process must be started from the very beginning. The ingredients will have to be discarded and you must start again with fresh ingredients.

**Slicing and storing bread**

For best results place bread on a wire rack and allow to cool for 15-30 minutes before slicing.

Use an electric knife or a sharp knife with a serrated blade for even slices.

Store unused bread tightly covered in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to three days. If weather is hot and humid, store in the refrigerator overnight.

For longer storage (up to one month), place bread in a tightly covered container in the freezer.

If you store the bread in the refrigerator, leave it out to bring it to room temperature before serving.

Since homemade bread has no preservatives it tends to dry out and become stale faster than commercially made bread.

Leftover slightly hardened bread may be cut into 1.3 cm (half inch) or 2.5cm (1 inch) cubes and used in favourite recipes to make croutons, bread pudding, or stuffing.
