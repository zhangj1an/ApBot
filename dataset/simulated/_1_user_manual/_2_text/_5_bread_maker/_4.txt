**BREAD MAKING**

1. Follow steps 1 to 7 on page 9 to set up the bread maker.
2. Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen.
3. To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark (and Rapid) on the display screen.
4. To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen.
5. Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program.

**RAPID**

The RAPID bread selection makes a loaf of bread in less time and is available on BASIC, WHOLE WHEAT, FRENCH and SWEET bread menus.

Selecting Rapid will bake a bread loaf to a medium crust colour and reduce the finishing time by about an hour. To select, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through until RAPID is displayed. (See BREAD, DOUGH & JAM SETTINGS table on page 8 for setting details).

**NOTE**

For best results, increase the yeast content in your bread recipe by ¬º teaspoon when using the Rapid setting.

**TIME DELAY**

1. If desired, press the TIMER button to change the start time on the bread maker.
2. The time displayed represents the finishing time. For example, if you adjust the Basic Bread default time 3:25 to 5:00, the bread will be finished at the end of 5 hours. The time can be delayed by up to 15 hours.
3. Press up arrow to increase the time in 10 minute increments or press down arrow to decrease the time in 10 minute increments.

**NOTE**

The Crust Colour, Loaf Size and Timer can only be adjusted on AUTO MENU selections 1-4. Selection 8 allows for the timer to be adjusted only. All other auto menu selections operate as per their default setting. See AUTO MENU Default Table on page 9.

**NOTE**

If the Timer is activated, the kneading blade will not mix the ingredients until the cycle is set to begin. For example, for Basic Bread the default time to complete the program is 3:25. If the delayed time is changed to 5:00, the cycle will not start for 1 hour 35 minutes after pressing START.

**NOTE**

Press START/CANCEL to start a selected MENU program.

**WARNING**

Do not touch the moving parts in the bread maker while the machine is working.

4. Once the baking cycle is complete, the bread maker will beep 10 times and switch to the Keep Warm setting for 1 hour. Press START/CANCEL for 1 second to cancel the Keep Warm function.
5. After 1 hour on the Keep Warm setting, the bread maker will beep once.
6. Let the bread pan cool down slightly before removing. Use oven mitts to lift the handle, and twist carefully to remove the bread pan from the bread maker.
7. To remove the bread loaf, turn the bread pan upside down and lightly shake until the loaf falls onto a wire cooling rack or clean surface.
8. Allow bread to cool for at least 10 minutes.
9. Remove the kneading blade from the base of the bread by using the kneading blade hook supplied. Hook the kneading blade hook into the groove in the centre of the kneading blade, and carefully pull out.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
During the kneading cycle, the bread maker may wobble and move slightly.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Both the bread pan and baking chamber will be hot and oven mitts should be used. Use the handle to remove the pan from the baking chamber.

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
Remove the kneading blade from the bread using the kneading blade hook before slicing.

üëÅÔ∏è NOTE

Use no more than 2 cups of ingredients as the maximum amount for the JAM function. Avoid high liquid fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes.

BAKE

1. Place pre-mixed ingredients into the bread pan and close the lid.
2. Press the MENU button until BAKE setting 12 is displayed on the screen.
