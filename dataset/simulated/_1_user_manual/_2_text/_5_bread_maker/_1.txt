**DELAY FUNCTION**  
Use this button to delay the start time for your desired program.  
Begin by determining the when a freshly baked loaf of bread is desired, then press the “+” and “–” buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments. Please note: Total time should include the delay time and the baking time of the selected program. In other words, at the completion of the total delay time, hot bread will be ready. Maximum delay time is 13 hours.

**Example:** At 8:30 p.m, if you would like your bread to be ready in the next morning at 7 a.m., i.e. in 10 hours and 30 minutes, select your menu, color, and loaf size, then press the “+” or “–” to add the time until “10:30” appears on the LCD screen. Then press the STOP/START button to activate this program. The dot will flash and the display will count down, showing the remaining time. You will get fresh bread at 7 o’clock in the morning. If you don’t want to take out the bread immediately, the keep warm time of 1 hour will begin automatically.

**Note:** 1. This button is not applicable for the Rapid Bake, Jam or Bake programs.  
2. For time-delayed baking, do not use any easily perishable ingredients such as eggs, fresh milk, fruits, vegetables, etc.

**KEEP WARM FUNCTION**  
Bread will be automatically kept warm for 60 minutes after baking. If you would like to take the bread out at any time after the selected program ends, switch the program off with the START/STOP button.

**AUTOMATIC DISPENSER FUNCTION**  
Put the fruit or nut into ingredient pan before start the program, when making bread, the program will put the ingredient in bread bucket automatically.

**MEMORY**  
If the power supply is interrupted during the course of bread making, the bread making process will be continued automatically within 10 minutes, even without pressing the START/STOP button. If the break time exceeds 10 minutes, the memory will not be saved and the bread maker must be restarted. However, if the dough is no further than the kneading phase when the power supply breaks off, press the “START/STOP” to restart the program from the beginning.

**OPERATING ENVIRONMENT**  
The machine may work well in a wide range of temperatures, but there could be a difference in loaf size between a very warm room and a very cold room. We suggest the room temperature be between 59 and 94°F (15 and 34°C).

⚠️ **WARNING DISPLAY:**

1. If the display shows “HHH” (accompanied by 5 beep sounds) after the program has been started, the temperature inside is still too high. In this case, the program has to be stopped. Open the lid and let the bread maker cool down for 10 to 20 minutes.

2. If the display shows “LLL” (accompanied by 5 beep sounds) after pressing the START/STOP button (except on the Bake program), the temperature inside is too low. Press the START/STOP button, open the lid, and let the machine rest for 10 to 20 minutes to return to room temperature.

3. If the display shows “EE0” after you have pressed START/STOP, the temperature sensor is disconnected. Please have the sensor checked by an authorized expert.

**FOR THE FIRST USE**

1. Please ensure all parts and accessories are complete and free of damage.

2. Clean all parts according to the section “Cleaning and Maintenance” below.

3. Set the bread maker in “Bake” mode and bake empty for about 10 minutes. After allowing it to cool down, clean once more.

4. Dry all parts thoroughly and reassemble. The appliance is now ready for use.

**HOW TO MAKE BREAD**

1. Place the pan in position and turn it clockwise until it clicks into correct position. Insert the kneading blade onto the drive shaft. It is recommended to fill holes with heat-resistant margarine prior to installing the kneaders; this prevents the dough from sticking below the kneaders and the kneaders can be more easily removed from bread.

2. Place ingredients into the bread pan. Please follow the order as outlined in the recipe. Usually the water or liquid substance should be added first, then sugar, salt and flour; always add yeast or baking powder as the final ingredient.
   Note: For the maximum quantities of the flour and yeast which may be used, refer to the recipe.

   ![Diagram of bread pan with layers labeled]
   - Yeast or soda
   - Dry ingredients
   - Water or liquid

**Note:** The maximum quantity of flour and yeast separately is 17oz (490g) and 0.2oz (6g).

3. Use your finger to make a small indentation on one side of the flour. Add yeast to indentation. Make sure yeast does not come into contact with the liquid ingredients or salt.

4. Close the lid gently and plug the power cord into a wall outlet.

5. Press the Menu button until your desired program is selected.

6. Press the COLOR button to select the desired crust color.

7. Press the LOAF button to select the desired size – 1.5LB or 2.0LB.

8. Set the delay time by pressing the + or – buttons. This step may be skipped if you want the bread maker to start working immediately.

9. Press the START/STOP button to start working, the working light will illuminate.

10. For the Basic, French, Whole Wheat, Quick, Sweet, Rapid Bake, Cake and Sandwich programs, 10 beep sounds will be heard during operation. This is to prompt you to add ingredients. It is possible that steam will escape through the vent slits in the lid during baking. This is normal.

11. Once the process has been completed, 10 beep sounds will be heard, and the working light will extinguish. Press START/STOP button for approx. 2 seconds to stop the process and remove bread. Open the lid and while using oven mitts, firmly grasp the bread pan handle. Turn the pan counter-clockwise and gently pull the pan straight up and out of the machine.

12. Use non-stick spatula to gently loosen the sides of the bread from the pan. 
Caution: The Bread pan and bread may be very hot! Always handle with care and use oven mitts.

13. Turn bread pan upside down onto a clean cooking surface and gently shake until bread falls out onto rack.

14. Remove the bread carefully from the pan and cool for about 20 minutes before slicing.

15. If you are out of the room or have not pressed START/STOP button at the end of operation, the bread will be kept warm automatically for 1 hour. If you would like to take the bread out, switch the program off with the START/STOP button.

16. When not in use, unplug the power cord.
Note: Before slicing the loaf, use the hook to remove the kneading blade hidden on the bottom of loaf. The loaf will be hot – never use bare hands to remove the kneading blade.

SPECIAL INTRODUCTION

1. For Quick breads
Quick breads are made with baking powder and baking soda that activates by moisture and heat. For perfect quick breads, it is suggested that all liquids be placed in the bottom of the bread pan and dry ingredients on top. During the initial mixing of quick bread, batter

and dry ingredients may collect in the corners of the pan, so it may be necessary to help machine mix to avoid flour clumps. If so, use a rubber spatula.

2. About Rapid Bake program  
The bread maker can bake a loaf within 1 hour on the Rapid Bake program. This setting can bake bread in 58 minutes; the bread will be a little denser in texture than bread baked on the normal Bake setting. Please note: water should be hot – in the range of 118 - 122°F (48 - 50°C) when added. Use a cooking thermometer to measure the temperature. The water temperature is very critical to the baking performance. If the water temperature is too low the bread will not rise to expected size; if the water temperature is too high it will kill the yeast prior to rising, which also will largely affect the baking performance.

**CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE**

Unplug the machine and let it cool down prior to cleaning.

1. **Bread pan:** Rub inside and outside with a damp cloth. Do not use any sharp or abrasive agents in order to protect the non-stick coating. The pan must be dried completely prior to use.

2. **Kneading blade:** If the kneading bar is difficult to remove from the axle, fill the container with warm water and allow it to soak for approx. 30 minutes. The kneader can then be easily removed for cleaning. Also, wipe the blade carefully with a cotton damp cloth. Please note: both the bread pan and kneading blade are dishwasher-safe components.

3. **Lid and window:** Clean the lid’s inside and outside with a slightly damp cloth.

4. **Housing:** Gently wipe the outer surface of housing with a wet cloth. Do not use any abrasive cleaner to clean as this would degrade the high polish of the surface. Never immerse the housing in water for cleaning.

5. Before the bread maker is packed away for storage, ensure that it has completely cooled down and is clean and dry; put the spoon and the kneading blade in the drawer and close lid.

**INTRODUCTION TO BREAD’S INGREDIENTS**

1. **Bread flour**  
Bread flour has a high gluten content, so it can be also be called high-gluten flour – also containing high protein content. It has an elastic texture and the bread retains its size after rising. Since the gluten content is higher than regular flour, it can be used for making larger loaves of bread with better inner fiber. Bread flour is the most important ingredient in making bread.

2. **Plain flour**  
Flour that contains no baking powder is better for making extouch bread.
