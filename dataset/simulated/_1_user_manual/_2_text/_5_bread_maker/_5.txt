**Start Baking**

1. The control panel display will light up and will sound a long beep. The appliance will automatically be set to the BASIC programme with the crust setting at MEDIUM. The display will show 3:00.
2. Choose a Programme with the MENU button.
3. Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed).
4. Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed).
5. Press START/STOP button to start the breadmaker.

⚠️

During the baking process, the main body and the lid will get hot. Be careful not to burn yourself.  
To cancel during a process, press and hold the START/STOP button until the breadmaker sounds once.
- Only as do this in an emergency, as the breadmaker will reset to the beginning of its program. You must then begin again as the ingredients may be ruined and need replacing.
- Only press this button after you have selected the Menu Program, Crust Colour (and Delay Time if required). Otherwise, it will not reset.

When the breadmaker is operating, only open the lid at the prescribed places in the baking cycle. Failure to observe this will affect the quality of the bread, especially its ability to rise properly.

**Remove the Bread Pan**

1. When the programme is completed, the display will show 0:00 and the appliance will beep 10 times. The breadmaker will continue baking the bread under the KEEP WARM function for another hour, but this will not be displayed.
2. Once this 1 hour KEEP WARM baking process is completed, the breadmaker will beep 10 times again and switch off. For best result, stop the breadmaker with the START/STOP button and remove the bread pan within this period.
3. Use oven gloves to hold the Handle. Turn the bread pan anti-clockwise to remove.

⚠️

Do not place the HOT bread pan on place mats that are vulnerable to heat as they may get damaged.

**Remove the Bread**

⚠️

Take care when removing the bread. The bread pan is VERY HOT!! Remember to wear oven gloves to hold the bread pan and kneading paddle.

1. Open the breadmaker’s lid.
2. Place a baking rack on a flat work top.
3. Turn the bread pan upside down, hold the handle and shake the loaf out.
4. Place the bread on the baking rack to cool down for about 10 minutes and to release moisture from the bottom of the bread.

5. Make sure the kneading paddle has been removed before slicing the bread.

⚠️ Occasionally, the kneading paddle will stay in the loaf; wait until the loaf is cool and then remove the kneading paddle with kneading paddle puller tool to avoid damage to the nonstick surface. If you need assistance to remove the loaf from the bread pan, use only wooden or heat proof plastic utensils.

After use

Unplug the breadmaker from the mains socket by holding the mains plug.

**Setting the Delay Timer**

The time delay function allows you to delay the start time of baking by up to 12 hours, depending on the length of the baking cycle.

For example: It is 8:00p.m. and you want to have fresh bread (using the Basic setting) at 7:00a.m.

The the difference between now (8:00p.m.) and 7:00a.m. is 11 hours. Connect the breadmaker to the mains socket. The preset cycle of 3:00 hours will be displayed.

| Steps                                                                 | Display / Button          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Set the display time to 11:00 (The time difference between now and   | Up arrow, down arrow      |
| when you want the bread).                                            | 1 11:00                   |
| Press to add time in 10 minutes steps.                               | TIME +                    |
| Press to deduct time in 10 minutes steps.                            | TIME -                    |
| Press the START/STOP button to start time delayed baking.            | START/STOP                |

If you keep the TIME+ or TIME- buttons pressed, they will cycle to a maximum of 13:00 hours and reset to the preset programme time (in this case 3:00 hours).

The timer display shows the total time left (in hours and minutes) until the bread is finished (including the delay added and the programme time). It does not display the 1 hour KEEP WARM time after the programme is finished.

Remember to press the START/STOP button to commence the timer countdown - otherwise nothing will happen. If you set the timer incorrectly after the START/STOP button has been pressed, you are able to switch off and reset the delay period again only if mixing has not started.

**Memory Recall**

If the mains supply is temporarily interrupted, the process of bread making will continue automatically when power is restored. However, if the interruption exceeds 15 minutes, the breadmaker must be restarted manually. If the process has gone no further than the kneading phase when the mains supply is cut off, you may press the START/STOP button to resume the programme from the beginning.

**Bread Recipes**

To get your started with your breadmaker, here is a selection of recipes. The recipes use fast action or easy bake dried yeast.

When adding ingredients add the water first, followed by any other liquid and semi-liquid ingredients. Next add the flour followed by the other dry ingredients. Tap the pan lightly on all sides to settle the flour. This prevents the yeast from coming into contact with the liquids. Finally add the yeast in a small heap in the centre of the pan.

![Warning symbol] The recipe quantities are sufficient to bake a 700g loaf. Scale them up for larger loaves.

**Care and Maintenance**

- Always disconnect the breadmaker from the mains supply immediately after use.
- Allow the breadmaker to cool down after use before you clean or store it. It takes about 30 minutes until the breadmaker is cool enough to be used again.
- Assist the breadmaker to cool down by leaving the lid open but ensure it is in a safe place away from children and pets.

**Cleaning and Care**

- Use only warm water with a mild liquid detergent for cleaning. Under no circumstances use chemical cleaners or solvents, oven cleaners or abrasive agents.
- Ensure the breadmaker is disconnected from the mains and has cooled down to the point where it can be safely handled.
- Pour some water into the bread pan and leave for a few minutes to assist it to cool down. Do not re-insert the bread pan into the breadmaker until it has been cleaned.
- The bread pan, kneading paddle and the Drive Shaft should be thoroughly cleaned in warm water with detergent. The bore in the kneading paddle can be cleaned with a soft bottle brush or similar implement.
- If you leave the kneading paddle fitted to the shaft it may be difficult to separate them afterwards. If this happens, fill the bread pan with warm water and add a few drops of liquid detergent. Leave it to stand for 30 minutes and then remove the kneading paddle from the shaft for cleaning.
- Rinse the bread pan and kneading paddle thoroughly to remove all traces of detergent and allow to dry. Wash the measuring cup and a spoon with sponge after every use.

- Remove all crumbs from the lid, housing and oven housing with a soft cloth.
- Wipe the housing inside and outside with a damp cloth.
- Do not immerse the breadmaker in water and never pour water into the oven housing.
- Do not allow the mains cable or mains plug to come into contact with water and do not pour water on the appliance or excessively wet the interior or the control panel.
- Clean and dry all parts carefully after use.
