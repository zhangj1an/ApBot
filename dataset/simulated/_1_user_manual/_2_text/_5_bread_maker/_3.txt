Quick-Start Guide

See “Detailed Instructions” section for additional information.

1 Add Ingredients

- Place kneading paddle on shaft, with arrow pointing up, pushing down as far as it will go, making sure flat surfaces are lined up.

- Carefully measure and add ingredients to the bread pan in the EXACT order given in the recipe.  
  TIP: Premeasure all ingredients, including add-ins (nuts, raisins) prior to beginning.

- Place bread pan in the breadmaker, turning clockwise until it locks into place. Close cover.  
  NOTE: Bread pan must lock into place for proper mixing and kneading.

BEFORE FIRST USE: Wash and dry bread pan and kneading paddle.  
NOTE: Do not use metal utensils in bread pan as they may damage nonstick surface.  
CAUTION! Falling Object Hazard. Breadmaker can wobble and walk during kneading cycle. Always position it in the center of the counter away from the edge.

LAST: Yeast. MUST be separate from wet ingredients  
SECOND: Dry ingredients (sugar, salt, shortening, flour)  
FIRST: Liquid ingredients – room temperature

2 Select Cycle

- Press CYCLE button until desired program number appears on the digital display.

- Press CRUST and LOAF buttons to ADJUST to desired setting (not adjustable in some cycles).

- To program a Delayed Start, use the Delay Timer + or – buttons to add up to 12 hours before Cycle will start. Refer to page 5 for additional information.

3 Start Making Bread

- Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle.

- Add-ins: After the second kneading cycle, 10 beeps will signal you to add fruit, nuts, etc.

- Once complete, breadmaker will beep and begin Keep Warm cycle for up to 1 hour.  
  Press START/STOP button for 2 seconds to cancel the Keep Warm cycle and turn off breadmaker.

- Using oven mitts, turn counterclockwise to unlock the bread pan, and pull bread pan straight up. Still using oven mitts, shake loaf from pan and let cool for 10 minutes.

**POWER INTERRUPTION**

In the event of a power outage, the process of making bread will continue automatically within 5 minutes. If the interruption time is longer than 5 minutes, the unit will not continue running and the display will revert back to the default setting (Cycle 1, Medium Color, and 2-lb. loaf). If the dough has started rising, discard the ingredients in the bread pan and start over. If the dough has not entered the rising phase, you can press the START/STOP button to continue the cycle from the beginning.

**WARNING DISPLAY**

“HHH” – This warning means that the temperature inside of the bread pan is too high. Stop the program, unplug the power cord, open the cover, and let the machine cool down completely before restarting.

“LLL” – This warning means that the temperature inside of the bread pan is too low. The room temperature is too low for the breadmaker to function.

**KEEP WARM**

After baking cycle is complete, the bread machine will shift to the Keep Warm setting for 1 hour. To cancel the Keep Warm process, press the START/STOP button for 2 seconds.

TIP: Removing bread immediately after baking cycle is complete will prevent crust from becoming darker.

Program Cycles

① Basic  
For white and mixed breads consisting mainly of basic bread flour.

② French  
For light breads made from fine flour. Normally, the bread is fluffy and has a crispy crust. This is not a suitable setting for recipes requiring butter, margarine, or milk.

③ Gluten-Free  
For gluten-free breads and mixes.

④ Quick  
For quick-bread recipes that do not use yeast for rising and instead may use baking powder or soda. Kneading, rising, and baking loaf within a time less than for basic bread.

⑤ Sweet  
For breads with additives such as fruit juices, grated coconut, raisins, dry fruits, chocolate, or added sugar. Due to a longer phase of rising, the bread will be light and airy.

⑥ 1.5 lb. Express  
Kneading, rising, and baking a 1.5-lb. loaf occurs in 58 minutes using a quick-rising yeast. Loaf will be smaller and rougher than that made with the Basic cycle.

⑦ 2.0 lb. Express  
Same as 1.5 lb. Express, but yields a 2-lb. loaf.

⑧ Dough  
This cycle prepares the yeast dough for buns, pizza crust, etc., to be baked in a conventional oven. There is no baking in this cycle.

⑨ Jam  
For making jams with fresh fruit.

⑩ Cake  
Kneading, rising, and baking occurs, but with the aid of soda or baking powder.

⑪ Whole Grain  
For breads with heavy varieties of flour that require a longer phase of kneading and rising (whole wheat flour, rye flour). Bread will be more compact and heavy.

⑫ Bake  
When additional baking of breads is needed because a loaf is too light or not baked through. There is no kneading or resting.

**Detailed Instructions**

**BEFORE FIRST USE:**
- Check for any missing or damaged parts.
- Clean all the parts according to the *Cleaning* section.
- Set the breadmaker on Bake mode and bake empty for about 10 minutes. Let unit cool down and clean all the detached parts again.

The appliance may emit a little smoke and/or odor when you turn it on for the first time. This is normal and will subside after the first or second use. Make sure the appliance has sufficient ventilation.
- Dry all parts thoroughly. The appliance is ready for use.

**LAST:** Yeast. MUST be separate from wet ingredients

**SECOND:** Dry ingredients (sugar, salt, shortening, flour)

**FIRST:** Liquid ingredients – room temperature

1. Using the bread pan handle, turn the bread pan counter-clockwise and then pull it out of the appliance.

2. Push the kneading paddle into the drive shaft inside the bread pan.  
   **CAUTION!** Falling Object Hazard. Breadmaker can wobble and walk during kneading cycle. Always position it in the center of the counter away from the edge.

3. Add the ingredients to the bread pan in the order listed in the recipe. First, add the liquids, sugar, and salt; then the flour; and last the yeast.  
   **NOTE:** Make sure that yeast does not come into contact with salt or liquids.

4. Place the bread pan into the appliance and make sure it is firmly locked in place by turning it clockwise. Close the lid.

5. Plug in the appliance. A beep will be heard and the display will default to Cycle 1.

6. Press the CYCLE button until your desired cycle is displayed.

7. Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size. (Loaf size is not an option in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.)

8. Press the CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust. (Crust is not adjustable in Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 5.)

**Detailed Instructions (cont.)**

9 If desired, set the DELAY TIMER with the + and – buttons. (Delay function is not available in Cycles ●, ●, and ●.)  
   **NOTE:** Do not use this feature when using dairy, eggs, etc.

10 Press the START/STOP button to begin the cycle. Breadmaker will beep once and the “- -” in the digital display will begin to flash indicating the timer is counting down. The kneading paddle will begin to mix your ingredients. If Delay Timer was activated, kneading paddle will not mix ingredients until cycle is set to begin.

11 For add-ins (nuts, raisins), the machine will beep at the start of the second kneading. Open the lid and pour in your add-ins. This timing varies by cycle. (Refer to the Timetable for Cycles chart.)

12 Once the cycle is complete, the machine will beep 10 times and shift to the Keep Warm setting for 1 hour.

13 To stop the machine, press the START/STOP button for 2 seconds and the Keep Warm setting will end. Unplug the power cord and then open the lid using oven mitts.

14 Let the bread pan cool down slightly before removing the bread. Using oven mitts, carefully turn the bread pan counterclockwise to unlock and lift up on the handle to remove from the machine.

15 Using oven mitts, turn the bread pan upside down (with the bread pan handle folded down) onto a wire cooling rack or clean cooking surface and gently shake until bread falls out. Use a nonstick spatula to gently loosen the sides of the bread from the bread pan.

16 If kneading paddle remains in the bread, gently pry it out using a spatula or small utensil. When not in use or when operation is complete, unplug the power cord.

**NOTE:** Store remaining bread in a sealed plastic bag for up to three days at room temperature. To store for a longer time, place sealed plastic bag in refrigerator for up to 10 days.
