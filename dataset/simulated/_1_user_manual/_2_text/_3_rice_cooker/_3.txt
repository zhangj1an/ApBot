**OPERATION**

**MEASURE THE RICE WITH LEVEL SCOOPS. DON’T OVERFILL.**

[Graphic: Three images of rice scoops, with the first two showing correct levels and the third showing an overfilled scoop with an "X" mark.]

Use the provided measuring cup or your own measuring cup for dry ingredients (white rice, brown rice, steel cut oats and quinoa). Use the measuring line on the removable bowl for water level. (Measurements are based on measuring cup provided. Ok to use your own.)

| Type       | Cups |
|------------|------|
| White Rice | 2    |
| White Rice | 1    |
| Brown Rice | 1.5  |

1. Use the provided measuring cup to add the desired amount of the rice to the inner pot.
2. Rinse rice or grain to remove excess starch and drain.
3. Fill with water to the line matching the number of cups of rice being cooked.
4. Place the inner pot into the rice cooker.
5. Close the lid.
6. Plug the rice cooker into an available 120V AC outlet.
7. Press Menu to select White Rice or Brown Rice, depending upon the type of rice being cooked. Use the same operation for Quinoa, and Steel Cut Oats, but no need to rinse.
8. Press START, the rice cooker will begin cooking. LED display will countdown the cooking time.
9. Once cooking is finished, the rice cooker will automatically switch to Keep Warm.
10. When finished serving rice, press Stop and unplug the power cord.

**NOTE**

- Brown rice requires a longer cooking cycle than other rice varieties due to the extra bran layers on the grains. The Brown Rice function allows extra time and adjusted heat settings in order to cook the rice properly. If it appears the rice cooker is not heating up immediately on Brown Rice, this is due to a low-heat soak cycle that precedes the cooking cycle to produce better brown rice results.
- Before placing the inner pot into the rice cooker, check that the outside is dry and free of debris. Adding the inner pot when wet may damage the rice cooker.
- Cooking times are approximate. Altitude, humidity and outside temperature will change cooking times.
- Opening the lid during the cooking cycle causes a loss of heat and steam. Cooking time may be prolonged if the lid is opened before the rice is finished.

TIPS
• 1 Measuring Cup is about 2/3 U.S. Cup. (Note measuring cup is included with unit.)
• This chart is only a general measuring guide. As there are many kinds of rice available, rice/water measurements may vary.
• Rinse rice prior to cooking to remove excess bran and starch. This will help reduce browning.
• To get perfect brown rice without the wait use the Delay Timer. Add rice and water in the morning and set the Delay Timer for when rice will be needed that night.
• For Quinoa and Steel Cut Oats, use caution to avoid escaping steam, open the lid and stir occasionally with a long-handled wooden spoon.
• Default time is the preset function time, adjust as per your preference using + or - control. Please defer to cooking time in chart.

CLEANING
1. Detach the inner cover and steam valve from lid by gently pulling it outward.
2. Inner pot, inner cover, and all accessories are top-rack dishwasher safe.
3. Wipe body, base, and top cover clean with a damp cloth.
4. Thoroughly dry body and accessories. Reassemble for next use.

• DO NOT use harsh abrasive cleaners, scouring pads, or products that are not considered safe to use on nonstick coatings.
• If using the dishwasher, a slight discoloration to the inner pot and accessories may occur. This is cosmetic only and will not affect performance.
