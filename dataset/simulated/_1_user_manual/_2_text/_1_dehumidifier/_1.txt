**OPERATING METHODS**

**Insert Power Plug**

Please assure consistency of power supply for the dehumidifier with power grid. The operating voltage for this dehumidifier is 220-240V~50Hz.

**Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation.**

This dehumidifier is complete with powerdown memory function. On the condition of direct interruption of power without shutdown, the dehumidifier automatically operates in the state before interruption after re-energization.

In standby state touch TIMER slightly, 88 on LCD will flicker, and slightly touch TIMER to adjust time, every one touch increases one hour (press and hold TIMER to increase time continuously). After over 24 hours numeral returns to 1 for circulation, after the set time expires, the dehumidifier automatically starts.

**During timing if time is to be changed, touch TIMER again to cancel timing and set up once more.**

**Timing Shutdown**

During operation of the dehumidifier, slightly touch TIMER, 88 on LCD will flicker for 5 times for confirmation, at the moment touch TIMER to adjust the set time as required, and the method is the same as that for startup.

[Image with symbols: AUTO, H2O %, TIMER, SWING, IONIZER, DRYING, POWER, MODE, SLEEP]

**Auto Dehumidification**

Initial startup of the dehumidifier defaults auto dehumidification mode or select this mode via MODE.

This mode can judge operating states in accordance with relative humidity in the room. In addition the humidity can also be set up for dehumidification with the setup range: 40%-45%-50%-55%-60%-65%-70%, which can be circularly selected. When the setup humidity is lower than ambient humidity, the compressor starts for dehumidification.

**Powerful dehumidification**

Select this item, the compressor starts regardless of relative humidity indoor, and the fan forces to operate by high-speed air for dehumidification.

**Mild dehumidification**

Select this item, the compressor starts regardless of relative humidity indoor, and the fan forces to operate by low-speed air for dehumidification.

**Tips**

In the above three dehumidification modes, if the air purification pattern (two small trees) flickers, it is not fault, but the filter (H E P A ) is not removed, and air purifying function is performed with dehumidification. If the HEPA filter is removed, the strainer pattern displays no filter.

**Ventilation function**

To operate this mode, first remove the HEPA filter, if not, the filter pattern flickers to remind the user of removing the HEPA filter. In order to guarantee service life of the HEPA filter, removal is recommended.

**Tips**

When it is humid and clothes are not easy to dry, operate in powerful dehumidification mode and press SWING, enabling auto swing to enlarge air supply range and effectively feed dry air to each corner for faster and more effective drying of clothes.

**Clothes Drying Effect**

**Internal drying mode**

Touch DRYING for over 2s to start internal drying process, which requires approximate one hour: Supply air (high-speed) operation lasts about 30min; the dehumidifier continues high-speed air operation and air guide blades sweep air at wide angle for about 10min; and then the dehumidifier continues high-speed air operation and air guide blades return to fixed position and continue operation for approximate 15min.

**How to Stop**

Press DRYING again for over 2s to cancel internal drying function and return to running status before startup of drying; press POWER to stop internal drying and recover standby;

---

**Press "HUMIDITY" and "TIMER" together to achieve transformation of fahrenheit and Centigrade.**

**AIR PURIFICATION AND USE OF FILTER**

**Purification function**

Slightly touch button MODE to select this mode, first judge whether the filter (HEPA filter) is installed or not, if installed, the purification pattern displays constantly, the fan starts high-speed air operation, air speed can be regulated via setup button HUMIDITY and is circularly selected among high-speed air low-speed air. Meanwhile accumulative timer begins.

For timing of use of filter, upper icons, i.e. six stars represent 24 hours, one star is displayed every 4 hours, two stars are displayed every 8 hours...and six stars are displayed every 24 hours, which is then transferred to one day directly. You can replace filter as appropriate according to local environmental quality, after replacement of strainer pressing reset button next to strainer can reset timer and begin timing again.

**Notice**

If the filter is not detected in air purification mode, the dehumidifier cannot operate, and the filter pattern flickers to prompt addition of filter.
