**REPLACING THE FILTER**

We recommend cleaning the filter with a vacuum cleaner once a month, and replacing it once a year or every 5000 hours of use. After 5000 hours of use, the sleep button will flash continuously as a reminder to replace the filter. After you have fitted a new filter, hold the sleep button down for 5 seconds to reset the timer.
