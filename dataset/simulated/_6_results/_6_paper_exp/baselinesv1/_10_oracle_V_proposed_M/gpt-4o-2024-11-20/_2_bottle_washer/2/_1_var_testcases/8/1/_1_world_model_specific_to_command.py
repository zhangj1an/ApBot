# The current implementation already supports the desired command to turn on the bottle warmer, use a plastic 
# bottle at room temperature with 7+ fl-oz. Here's why the current code is accurate:

# Sequence of features required to achieve the command:
# 1. Turn on the bottle warmer using the "power_toggle_or_start_warming" feature.
# User manual text: **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off.
# Corresponding feature in code: "power_toggle_or_start_warming"

# 2. Adjust the bottle type to "Plastic" using the "adjust_bottle_type" feature.
# User manual text: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                   |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                   | Milk bag      | Room- 25℃ (77℉)           | 1-3 fl-oz    |
#                   | Plastic       | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2℉)        | 4-6 fl-oz    |
#                   | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
# Corresponding feature in code: "adjust_bottle_type"

# 3. Set the initial temperature to "Room" using the "adjust_initial_temp" feature.
# User manual text: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                   |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                   | Milk bag      | Room- 25℃ (77℉)           | 1-3 fl-oz    |
#                   | Plastic       | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2℉)        | 4-6 fl-oz    |
#                   | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
# Corresponding feature in code: "adjust_initial_temp"

# 4. Set the volume to "7+ fl-oz" using the "adjust_volume" feature.
# User manual text: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                   |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                   | Milk bag      | Room- 25℃ (77℉)           | 1-3 fl-oz    |
#                   | Plastic       | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2℉)        | 4-6 fl-oz    |
#                   | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
# Corresponding feature in code: "adjust_volume"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_bottle_type` to "Plastic".
# 3. Set `variable_initial_temp` to "Room".
# 4. Set `variable_volume` to "7+ fl-oz".
