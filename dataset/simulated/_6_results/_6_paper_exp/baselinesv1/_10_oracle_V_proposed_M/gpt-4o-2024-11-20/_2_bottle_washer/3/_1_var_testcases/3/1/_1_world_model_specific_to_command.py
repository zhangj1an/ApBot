# Checking the current code and its completeness for the given command.

# The user command is:

# Relevant steps per user manual:
# 1) Power On: "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    (Already part of the feature `power_on_off` with variable `variable_power_on_off` in current code.)
# 2) Select Wash Only mode: "Touch the 'wash mode' button to choose a wash cycle."
#    (Already part of the feature `set_wash_mode` with variable `variable_wash_mode` in current code.)
# 3) Press Start: "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    (Already part of the feature `start_appliance` with variable `variable_start_running` in current code.)

# All features, variables, and actions necessary to achieve the user command are correctly implemented in the current code. There is no missing feature or action.

# Sequence of features required to fulfill the user command:
# 1. Use "power_on_off" feature to switch the Bottle Washer Pro® on.
# 2. Use "set_wash_mode" feature to set it to 'Wash Only' mode.
# 3. Use "start_appliance" feature to begin the operation.

# Quoting relevant user manual text for each feature:
# - For "power_on_off":
#   "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."
# - For "set_wash_mode":
#   "Touch the 'wash mode' button to choose a wash cycle."
# - For "start_appliance":
#   "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
