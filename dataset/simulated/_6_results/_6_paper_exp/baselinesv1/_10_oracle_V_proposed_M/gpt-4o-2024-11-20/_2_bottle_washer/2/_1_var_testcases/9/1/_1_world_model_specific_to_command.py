# The current code appears to model the appliance features accurately with respect to the user command. 
# Here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the user command "Power on the appliance and set it for a silicone bottle, frozen (0℃), with a volume of 1-3 fl-oz":
# 
# 1. "power_toggle_or_start_warming": Toggle the power on. 
#    User manual reference: **ON/OFF:** "Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off."
#    Corresponding feature_list: "power_toggle_or_start_warming"
# 
# 2. "adjust_bottle_type": Set bottle type to "Silicone."
#    User manual reference: **Select bottle → Silicone**
#    Corresponding feature_list: "adjust_bottle_type"
# 
# 3. "adjust_initial_temp": Set initial temperature to "Frozen (0℃)."
#    User manual reference: **Select initial temp → Frozen-0℃ (32℉)**
#    Corresponding feature_list: "adjust_initial_temp"
# 
# 4. "adjust_volume": Set volume to "1-3 fl-oz."
#    User manual reference: **Select Volume → 1-3 fl-oz**
#    Corresponding feature_list: "adjust_volume"
# 
# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - variable_power_on_off: "on"
# - variable_bottle_type: "Silicone"
# - variable_initial_temp: "Frozen"
# - variable_volume: "1-3 fl-oz"
# 
# No new variables or feature modifications are required, as the code already supports these functionalities.
