# The given code correctly models the appliance feature required to achieve the command: 
# "Turn on the washer and perform a 35-minute auto cycle."
# Here is the reasoning:

# 1. To turn on the washer, the feature "power_on_off" is relevant.
#    User manual text: "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off."
#    Feature: feature_list["power_on_off"].
# Goal: Set variable_power_on_off to "on".

# 2. To perform a 35-minute auto cycle, the feature "auto_mode" is relevant.
#    User manual text: "Press this button to start a drying then sterilising cycle. Press once for 35 minutes cycle, 25 minutes drying and 10 minutes sterilising."
#    Feature: feature_list["auto_mode"].
# Goal: Set variable_auto_mode to "35_minutes".

# Sequence of features required to execute the user command:
# - "power_on_off": Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - "auto_mode": Set variable_auto_mode to "35_minutes".

# As the features and variables are correctly modeled in the existing code, no modification is required.
