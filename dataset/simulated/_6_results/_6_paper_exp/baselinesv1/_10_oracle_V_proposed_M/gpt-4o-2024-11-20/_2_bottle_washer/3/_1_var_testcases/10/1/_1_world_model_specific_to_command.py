#    Raw user manual text: "Sterilize & Dry: Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 1 time, then press the Start/Pause button to start."
# 3. Press start to begin: Feature name in the code: "start_appliance".
#    Raw user manual text: "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
