# The user command "Power up the washer and dry the bottles for 40 minutes" is achievable with the current code. 
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is:
# 1. Activate the "power_on_off" feature to turn the machine on.
# 2. Then select the "drying_only" feature to set the drying time to 40 minutes.

# Corresponding variable changes:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" to turn the machine on.
# - Set `variable_drying_only_time` to "40_minutes" to select 40-minute drying.

# Relevant user manual sections:
# "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off." -> Models `power_on_off` feature.
# "Press this button once for 30 minutes drying, twice for 40 minutes drying and three times for 50 minutes drying." -> Models `drying_only` feature.

# Features used:
# - feature_list["power_on_off"]: To power on the steriliser.
# - feature_list["drying_only"]: To select drying time of 40 minutes.

# No modifications are required as all necessary features, actions, and variables are already correctly modeled.
