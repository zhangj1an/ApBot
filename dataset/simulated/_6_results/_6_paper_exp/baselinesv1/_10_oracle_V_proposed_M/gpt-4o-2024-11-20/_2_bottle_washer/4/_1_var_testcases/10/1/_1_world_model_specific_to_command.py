# User manual: "Tap the menu button to cycle through various function modes ("Quick", "Slow", "Defrost", "Sterilize", "Steam", "Preset")."
# feature_list name in the given code: "set_menu_and_adjust_setting"
# Goal variable values: Set `variable_menu_index` to "Steam".

# 3. Adjust "Steam" time setting:
# User manual: "Steam function time setting (default 12 minutes, adjustable using +/-)"
# feature_list name in the given code: "set_menu_and_adjust_setting"
