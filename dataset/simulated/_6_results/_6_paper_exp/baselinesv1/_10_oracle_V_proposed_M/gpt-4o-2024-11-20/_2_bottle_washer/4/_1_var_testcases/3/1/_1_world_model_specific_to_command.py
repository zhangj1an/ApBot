# The current code has accurately modeled the feature to turn on the appliance, set the defrost function, and adjust the defrost time.
# Here are the sequence of features required to achieve this user command:
# 1. Feature: "power_on_off" - Turn the appliance on.
#    - User Manual: "Tap the power button to shut down the appliance."
# 2. Feature: "set_menu_and_adjust_setting" - Set menu to "Defrost".
#    - User Manual: "Tap the menu button until the 'defrost' function appears."
# 3. Adjust menu setting to match the desired defrost time - Adjust the defrost time to 5 minutes using +/- buttons.
#    - User Manual: "Tap the menu button until the defrost function appears. Using the +/- adjust a time needed for defrosting. The larger or colder the item is, the longer length of time is needed for defrosting."

# Goal Variable Values:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_menu_index` to "Defrost".
# 3. Set `variable_menu_setting_defrost` to 5.
