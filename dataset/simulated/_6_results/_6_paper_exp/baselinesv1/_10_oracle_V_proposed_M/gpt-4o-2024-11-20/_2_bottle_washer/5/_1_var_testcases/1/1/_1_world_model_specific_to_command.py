# The given user command "Turn on the washer and sterilize the bottles for 10 minutes" can be addressed, as the relevant appliance features appear to be modeled correctly. Below are the necessary steps corresponding to the user manual and existing code:

# Sequence of features required to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn the appliance on (set variable_power_on_off to "on").
#    User manual text: "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off."
#    Feature in code: feature_list["power_on_off"]
# 2. Use the "sterilise_only" feature to set sterilization to 10 minutes (set variable_sterilise_only_time to "10_minutes").
#    User manual text: "Press this button once for 10 minutes sterilisation and twice for 35 minutes sterilisation."
#    Feature in code: feature_list["sterilise_only"]

# Goal variable values:
# 1. variable_power_on_off = "on"
