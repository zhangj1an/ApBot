# User Command: Power on and remove stains from durable clothes, using Stain Away cycle, 60°C temperature, 1400 rpm spin speed, Soak + Rinse+ option, set delay to 5 hours, and start the machine.

# Python comment to verify modeling accuracy:
# The current implementation of the code includes all the necessary features and variables to achieve the command:
#  1. Power On/Off: "press_power_button" action with the feature "power_on_off".
#  2. Set cycle to "Stain Away": Enables selecting a tumble pattern using "adjust_cycle_selector".
#  3. Set temperature to "60°C": Adjusting via "adjust_temperature".
#  4. Set spin speed to "1400": Adjusting using "adjust_spin_speed".
#  5. Set option to "Soak + Rinse+": Through "adjust_options".
#  6. Set delay to "5 hours": Configured using "adjust_delay_end".
#  7. Start the machine: Enabled by the "start_pause_cycle" feature and "press_start_pause_button" action.
# There is nothing missing to model this user command adequately.

# Features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "power_on_off" feature:
#    "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on."
#    Raw text supports this step and is modeled in feature_list["power_on_off"].
#
# 2. "adjust_cycle_selector" feature:
#    "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle." (from user manual description).
#    Modeled feature: feature_list["adjust_cycle_selector"].
#
# 3. "adjust_temperature" feature:
#    "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options."
#    Modeled feature: feature_list["adjust_temperature"].
#
# 4. "adjust_spin_speed" feature:
#    "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    Modeled feature: feature_list["adjust_spin_speed"].
#
# 5. "adjust_options" feature:
#    "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak + Rinse+, etc."
#    Modeled as: feature_list["adjust_options"].
#
# 6. "adjust_delay_end" feature:
#    "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options."
#    Reflected in feature_list["adjust_delay_end"].
#
# 7. "start_pause_cycle" feature:
#    "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."
#    Documented as: feature_list["start_pause_cycle"].

# Goal variable settings to achieve this command:
# - variable_power_on_off: "on"
# - variable_cycle_selector: "Stain Away"
# - variable_temperature: "60°C"
# - variable_spin_speed: "1400"
# - variable_option: "Soak + Rinse+"
# - variable_delay_end: 5
# - variable_start_running: "on"
