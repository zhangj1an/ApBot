# Python comments:
# To achieve the command "Switch the washing machine on, use the Normal program, set the water level to 32 L, and finish in 3 hours. Then start the appliance, then activate the child lock," the described features in the existing code are correctly implemented. Each step of the command can be achieved through the provided features and action effects. 

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is as follows:
# 1. "power" - Switch the washing machine on by setting variable_power_on_off to "on".
#    - Raw user manual text: Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press “Start/Pause” within 10 minutes after power-on.
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "power"
# 2. "select_program" - Use the Normal program by setting variable_program_selection to "1 Normal".
#    - Raw user manual text: Programs - Variety of Programs allows selection from Normal, Delicate, Baby-care, etc.
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "select_program"
# 3. "adjust_water_level" - Set the water level to 32 L using variable_water_level.
#    - Raw user manual text: Change Water Level - During the wash process, press “Water Level” to change the water level.
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "adjust_water_level"
# 4. "set_preset_timer" - Set the finish time to 3 hours using variable_preset_timer.
#    - Raw user manual text: Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours).
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "set_preset_timer"
# 5. "start_operation" - Start the appliance by setting variable_start_running to "on".
#    - Raw user manual text: 3. Start. - Press Start/Pause.
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "start_operation"
# 6. "child_lock" - Activate the child lock by setting variable_child_lock to "on".
#    - Raw user manual text: Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed.
#    - Relevant feature_list name: "child_lock"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. variable_power_on_off = "on"
# 2. variable_program_selection = "1 Normal"
# 3. variable_water_level = "32 L"
# 4. variable_preset_timer = 3
# 5. variable_start_running = "on"
# 6. variable_child_lock = "on"
