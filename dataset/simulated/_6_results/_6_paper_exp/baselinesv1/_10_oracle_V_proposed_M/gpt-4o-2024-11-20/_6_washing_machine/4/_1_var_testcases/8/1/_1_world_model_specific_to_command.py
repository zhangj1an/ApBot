# Checking the user manual against the given code:
# The user manual descriptions indicate that all the necessary features for achieving the user command are correctly implemented in the `feature_list` and variables provided in the code. 
# Specifically: 
# - The power control is modeled in `power_control`, corresponding to "Turn on the washing machine."
# - The program selection is modeled in `select_program`, corresponding to "Set the machine to Fuzzy."
# - The delay timer adjustment is modeled in `adjust_delay_timer`, corresponding to "Delay start by 5 hours."
# - The water level adjustment is modeled in `adjust_water_level`, corresponding to "Set water level to 40 L."
# - The washing time adjustment is modeled in `adjust_washing_time`, corresponding to "Set wash time to 15 minutes."
# - The rinse type adjustment is modeled in `adjust_rinse_type`, corresponding to "Set rinse type to 'Water-Injection Rinse 1 time.'"
# - The start/pause control is modeled in `start_pause_control`, corresponding to "Start the machine running."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. `power_control`: Turn the machine on.
# 2. `select_program`: Set the program to "P1 (Fuzzy)."
# 3. `adjust_delay_timer`: Set the delay start to 5 hours.
# 4. `adjust_water_level`: Set the water level to 40 L.
# 5. `adjust_washing_time`: Set the washing time to 15 minutes.
# 6. `adjust_rinse_type`: Set the rinse type to "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time."
# 7. `start_pause_control`: Start the machine running.

# Relevant user manual text:
# - **Power Button**: "Press this button to switch power on and off. The washing machine automatically switches off when operations are finished. The washing machine also turns off automatically if it is not operated or no button is pressed for 20 minutes after the power has been turned on."
# - **Program Button**: "Selects programs. The program changes each time the button is pressed."
# - **Delay Button**: "The delay time can be set between 3 and 12 hours."
# - **Water Level Button**: "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."
# - **Wash Button**: "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
# - **Rinse Button**: "You can set the number and type of rinses by pressing the Rinse button. Each time you press the Rinse button the setting changes in sequence, from Normal Rinse 2 times, Water-Injection Rinse 2 times, no rinsing, Normal Rinse 1 time, Water-Injection Rinse 1 time."
# - **Start/Pause Button**: "Starts and pauses operation. When the washing machine is paused for over one hour and no operations are done, it turns off automatically."

# Feature list implementation in the code:
# The feature_list in the current code already reflects these details:
# - power_control -> Controls power state (variable_power_on_off)
# - select_program -> Adjusts washing program (variable_program)
# - adjust_delay_timer -> Sets delay start time (variable_delay_timer)
# - adjust_water_level -> Adjusts water level (variable_water_level)
# - adjust_washing_time -> Adjusts washing time (variable_washing_time)
# - adjust_rinse_type -> Adjusts rinse type (variable_rinse_type)
# - start_pause_control -> Starts or pauses the operation (variable_start_running)

# Goal variable values:
# - variable_power_on_off: "on"
# - variable_program: "P1 (Fuzzy)"
# - variable_delay_timer: 5 (5 hours)
# - variable_water_level: 40 (40 L)
# - variable_washing_time: 15 (15 minutes)
# - variable_rinse_type: "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time"
# - variable_start_running: "start"
