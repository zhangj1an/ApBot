# The current implementation correctly models the appliance's features and allows achieving the requested user command.
# Below are the sequence of features that need to be followed to achieve the user command:
# Features needed:
# 1. "power_control" to turn the washing machine on.
# 2. "set_program" to set the washing program to 'Bedding'.
# 3. "adjust_water_level" to set the water level to 'High'.
# 4. "adjust_time_manager" to allocate 40 minutes.
# 5. "adjust_rinse_times" to set rinse to '3 Times'.
# 6. "adjust_spin_speed" to set spin to 'Short'.
#
# Relevant raw user manual texts:
# - "1 On/Off button: Product is switched On or Off."
# - "Program: Available according to the laundry type."
# - "Water Level: Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers."
# - "Time Manager: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
# - "Rinse: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
# - "Spin: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
#
# These features are already sufficiently described in the provided feature_list and Simulator class.

# Goal variable values for the user command:
# - variable_on_off: "on"
# - variable_program: "Bedding"
# - variable_water_level: "High" (mapped to the appropriate value in `variable_water_level.value_range`)
# - variable_time_manager: "40" (mapped to the appropriate value in `variable_time_manager.value_range`)
# - variable_rinse_times: "3 Times"
# - variable_spin_speed: "Short"

# Since no modifications to the existing implementation are needed, we'll create an empty ExtendedSimulator class.
