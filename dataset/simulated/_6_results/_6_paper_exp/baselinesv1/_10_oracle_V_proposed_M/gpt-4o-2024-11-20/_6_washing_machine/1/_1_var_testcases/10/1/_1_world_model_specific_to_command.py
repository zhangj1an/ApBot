# Python Comment: The current code is accurate in modeling the relevant features required to achieve the user command.

# Sequence of Features Needed to Achieve the Command:
# 1. Power on the washing machine.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
#    - Feature List Name: "power_on_off"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".

# 2. Select the Hand Wash cycle.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
#    - Feature List Name: "adjust_cycle_selector"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_cycle_selector` to "Hand Wash".

# 3. Adjust the temperature to 20 °C.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 95 °C."
#    - Feature List Name: "adjust_temperature"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_temperature` to "20°C".

# 4. Adjust the spin speed to 1200 rpm.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    - Feature List Name: "adjust_spin_speed"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_spin_speed` to "1200".

# 5. Adjust the option to "Soak + Rinse+".
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak > Intensive > Prewash > Rinse+ > Soak + Rinse+ > Intensive + Rinse+ > Prewash + Rinse+ > off."
#    - Feature List Name: "adjust_options"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_option` to "Soak + Rinse+".

# 6. Set the delay to 5 hours.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
#    - Feature List Name: "adjust_delay_end"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_delay_end` to "5".

# 7. Start the washing machine.
#    - Raw User Manual Text: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."
#    - Feature List Name: "start_pause_cycle"
#    - Goal: Set `variable_start_running` to "on".

# Goal Variable Values:
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_power_on_off": "on",
    "variable_cycle_selector": "Hand Wash",
    "variable_temperature": "20°C",
    "variable_spin_speed": "1200",
    "variable_option": "Soak + Rinse+",
    "variable_delay_end": 5,
    "variable_start_running": "on"
}
