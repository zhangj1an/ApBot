# The user manual describes multiple adjustable variables such as program, water level, spin speed, rinse times, and more.
# All relevant features seem to be modeled in the existing code. The steps provided in the feature_list align well with the user manual's descriptions:
# 1. The user command begins with switching on the washing machine (feature: "power_control").
# 2. Selecting the "Mixed" program (feature: "set_program").
# 3. Selecting "Low" water level (feature: "adjust_water_level").
# 4. Setting rinse to "1 time" (feature: "adjust_rinse_times").
# 5. Setting spin for "Long" (implicitly modeled in "adjust_spin_speed").
# 6. Starting the washing cycle (feature: "start_pause").
# Based on the code and manual, all necessary variables and features are present and modeled without issues. Here is the sequence to achieve the command:

# Sequence of features:
# - "power_control" to switch on the machine.
# - "set_program" to select "Mixed" program.
# - "adjust_water_level" to set "Low" water level.
# - "adjust_rinse_times" to select rinse "1 Time".
# - "adjust_spin_speed" to set spin for "Long".
# - "start_pause" to begin the washing cycle.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - variable_on_off = "on"
# - variable_program = "Mixed"
# - variable_water_level = "2" (assume "Low" corresponds to 2 from descriptions)
# - variable_rinse_times = "1 time"
# - variable_spin_speed = "Low"
# - variable_start_running = "on"
