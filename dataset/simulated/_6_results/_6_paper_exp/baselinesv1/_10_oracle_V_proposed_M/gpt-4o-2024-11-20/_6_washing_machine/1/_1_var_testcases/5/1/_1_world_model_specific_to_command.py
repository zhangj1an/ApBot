# Python comment:
# The current code correctly models the appliance feature for the provided command, as follows:
# 1. Adjusting the cycle selector to "Daily Wash" corresponds to feature: "adjust_cycle_selector".
#    - User manual: "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
#    - Feature list: "adjust_cycle_selector"
# 2. Adjusting the temperature to "40°C" corresponds to feature: "adjust_temperature".
#    - User manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options."
#    - Feature list: "adjust_temperature"
# 3. Adjusting the spin to "1200 rpm" corresponds to feature: "adjust_spin_speed".
#    - User manual: "Press the Spin button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    - Feature list: "adjust_spin_speed"
# 4. Adjusting the option to "Intensive" corresponds to feature: "adjust_options".
#    - User manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options."
#    - Feature list: "adjust_options"
# 5. Adjusting the delay end to 5 hours corresponds to feature: "adjust_delay_end".
#    - User manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
#    - Feature list: "adjust_delay_end"
# 6. Starting the machine corresponds to feature: "start_pause_cycle".
#    - User manual: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."
#    - Feature list: "start_pause_cycle"
# 7. The power-on action corresponds to feature: "power_on_off".
#    - User manual: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
#    - Feature list: "power_on_off"
# The requested command can be achieved with the given code.

# Required sequence of features to achieve the command:
# Feature: "power_on_off" - Turn on the appliance.
# Feature: "adjust_cycle_selector" - Set cycle selector to "Daily Wash".
# Feature: "adjust_temperature" - Set temperature to "40°C".
# Feature: "adjust_spin_speed" - Set spin speed to "1200 rpm".
# Feature: "adjust_options" - Set option to "Intensive".
# Feature: "adjust_delay_end" - Set delay end to 5 hours.
# Feature: "start_pause_cycle" - Start the cycle.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# 2. Set variable_cycle_selector to "Daily Wash".
# 3. Set variable_temperature to "40°C".
# 4. Set variable_spin_speed to "1200".
# 5. Set variable_option to "Intensive".
# 6. Set variable_delay_end to 5.
# 7. Set variable_start_running to "on".
