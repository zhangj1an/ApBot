# The current code accurately captures the relevant features needed for the user command. 
# Below, we outline the sequence of features to achieve the command and provide relevant details.

# Sequence of features needed:
# 1. "power_control" - Switch the washing machine on.
#    - User manual: **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["power_control"].
# 2. "set_program" - Select the 'Quick Wash' program.
#    - User manual: **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["set_program"].
# 3. "adjust_water_level" - Select 'Low' water level.
#    - User manual: **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["adjust_water_level"].
# 4. "adjust_time_manager" - Set 15 minutes as washing time (closest approximation since actual time value choices are not explicitly modeled).
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["adjust_time_manager"].
# 5. "adjust_rinse_times" - Rinse '2 Times'.
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["adjust_rinse_times"].
# 6. "adjust_spin_speed" - Set spinning to 'Regular'.
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - Feature name in code: feature_list["adjust_spin_speed"].

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_on_off": "on",                  # Step 1: Switch machine On
    "variable_program": "Quick Wash",        # Step 2: Select program 'Quick Wash'
    "variable_water_level": "2",             # Step 3: Set water level to 'Low' (interpret 2 as low)
    "variable_time_manager": "3",            # Step 4: Set time manager to '15 minutes' (since time approx.)
    "variable_rinse_times": "2 times",       # Step 5: Rinse '2 Times'
    "variable_spin_speed": "Medium",         # Step 6: Set spinning speed to 'Regular' (interpreted as Medium)
}
# Based on the above analysis, no updates are needed for this code.
