# The current code has correctly modeled the functionalities from the user manual. Based on the provided user command, here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the task:

# Sequence of features:
# 1. Power on: Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn the washing machine on.
# 2. Set the cycle selector to "15' Quick Wash": Use the "adjust_cycle_selector" feature.
# 3. Set water temperature to "Cold water": Use the "adjust_temperature" feature.
# 4. Set spin speed to "400 rpm": Use the "adjust_spin_speed" feature.
# 5. Set options to "Rinse+": Use the "adjust_options" feature.
# 6. Set delay to 5 hours: Use the "adjust_delay_end" feature.
# 7. Start the machine: Use the "start_pause_cycle" feature.

# Raw user manual excerpts:
# - Power on/off: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
