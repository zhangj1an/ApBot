# Python comments:
# Based on the user manual, the provided code sufficiently models the features needed to achieve the user command: 
# Switch on, apply 'Wool' program, use 'High' water, designate 45 minutes, perform '3 Times' rinse, spin 'Regular'.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "power_control" - Turn the appliance on by toggling the on/off variable.
# 2. "set_program" - Set the washing program to 'Wool'.
# 3. "adjust_water_level" - Adjust water level to 'High' (use step 3 as 'High' aligns with the 3rd level in the range).
# 4. "adjust_time_manager" - Use time manager to designate the appropriate washing time. 
# 5. "adjust_rinse_times" - Set rinse to '3 Times'.
# 6. "adjust_spin_speed" - Set spin speed to 'Regular'.

# Relevant Features and Feature List Names in the Code:
# - power_control: Relevant user manual text - **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.
# - set_program: Relevant user manual text - **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.
# - adjust_water_level: Relevant user manual text - **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.
# - adjust_time_manager: Relevant user manual text - **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
# - adjust_rinse_times: Relevant user manual text - **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
# - adjust_spin_speed: Relevant user manual text - **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
