# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance features to achieve the requested user command: 
# "Turn on the washing machine, set it to 'Regular' program, choose 'High' water level, allocate 45 minutes for time management, rinse '2 Times', and spin 'Regular'."
# The sequence of features needed is:
# 1. "power_control" to turn the machine on. 
# 2. "set_program" to set the program to 'Regular'.
# 3. "adjust_water_level" to set the water level to 'High'.
# 4. "adjust_time_manager" to allocate 45 minutes using time management (assuming the numeric values are processed correctly by "variable_time_manager").
# 5. "adjust_rinse_times" to set rinse times to "2 Times".
# 6. "adjust_spin_speed" to set the spin speed to 'Regular'.

# Below is the class that extends the existing Simulator without adding or modifying any features as the current code already meets requirements.
