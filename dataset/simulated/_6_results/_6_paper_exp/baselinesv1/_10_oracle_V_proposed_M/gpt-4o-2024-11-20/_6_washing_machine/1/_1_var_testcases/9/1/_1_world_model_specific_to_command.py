# Python comments explaining the analysis of the given code and user command:

# Based on the user manual, the following features are needed to fulfill the user command:
# 1. Power on the appliance.
#    - User manual: Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off.
#    - Feature in code: "power_on_off"
#
# 2. Select the "Wool" cycle.
#    - User manual: Cycle Selector: Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle.
#    - Feature in code: "adjust_cycle_selector"
#
# 3. Set the water temperature to "Cold water."
#    - User manual: Temp button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: Cold water üå°Ô∏è, 20 ¬∞C, 30 ¬∞C, 40 ¬∞C, 60 ¬∞C, and 95 ¬∞C.
#    - Feature in code: "adjust_temperature"
#
# 4. Set the spin speed to 1200 rpm.
#    - User manual: Spin button: Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle.
#    - Feature in code: "adjust_spin_speed"
#
# 5. Set the option to "Soak + Rinse+."
#    - User manual: Option button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options.
#    - Feature in code: "adjust_options"
#
# 6. Set delay end to 5 hours.
#    - User manual: Delay End: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments).
#    - Feature in code: "adjust_delay_end"
#
# 7. Start the machine.
#    - User manual: Press this button to pause and restart a cycle.
#    - Feature in code: "start_pause_cycle"
#
# Observation: All the steps described above are correctly represented in the existing code. The needed features and actions are fully modeled successfully in the feature_list of the Simulator class.

# Therefore, no modifications to the code are necessary. Below is a sequence of steps to achieve the user command along with the goal variable values.

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator): 
    pass

# Sequence of features and actions needed to achieve the user command:
# - Feature: "power_on_off"
#   * Action: press_power_button
# - Feature: "adjust_cycle_selector"
#   * Action: turn_cycle_selector_dial_clockwise / turn_cycle_selector_dial_anticlockwise
# - Feature: "adjust_temperature"
#   * Action: press_temp_button
# - Feature: "adjust_spin_speed"
#   * Action: press_spin_button
# - Feature: "adjust_options"
#   * Action: press_option_button
# - Feature: "adjust_delay_end"
#   * Action: press_delay_end_button
# - Feature: "start_pause_cycle"
#   * Action: press_start_pause_button

# Goal variable values to fulfill the user command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on" (power the machine on).
# - Set variable_cycle_selector to "Wool."
# - Set variable_temperature to "Cold water."
# - Set variable_spin_speed to "1200."
# - Set variable_option to "Soak + Rinse+."
# - Set variable_delay_end to 5 hours.
# - Set variable_start_running to "on" (start the cycle).
