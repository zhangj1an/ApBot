# Python comments verifying the code functionality and feature correctness.

# The relevant features to achieve the user command are as follows:
# 1. Turn on the washing machine.
#    - User manual raw text: "Press this button to switch power on and off."
#    - Corresponding feature: "power_control" in feature_list.
#
# 2. Set it to perform a Speedy wash.
#    - User manual raw text: "Selects programs. The program changes each time the button is pressed."
#    - Corresponding feature: "select_program" in feature_list.
#
# 3. Use a water level of 35 L.
#    - User manual raw text: "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."
#    - Corresponding feature: "adjust_water_level" in feature_list.
#
# 4. Wash for 6 minutes only.
#    - User manual raw text: "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
#    - Corresponding feature: "adjust_washing_time" in feature_list.
#
# 5. No rinse.
#    - User manual raw text: "You can set the number and type of rinses by pressing the Rinse button."
#    - Corresponding feature: "adjust_rinse_type" in feature_list.
#
# 6. Start the machine running.
#    - User manual raw text: "Starts and pauses operation."
#    - Corresponding feature: "start_pause_control" in feature_list.

# The current code correctly models all the required appliance features to achieve the user command. No additional variables or feature modifications are needed.

# Sequence of features to achieve this command:
# 1. Activate the "power_control" feature and set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# 2. Activate the "select_program" feature and set variable_program to "P3 (Speedy)".
# 3. Activate the "adjust_water_level" feature and set variable_water_level to 35.
# 4. Activate the "adjust_washing_time" feature and set variable_washing_time to 6.
# 5. Activate the "adjust_rinse_type" feature and set variable_rinse_type to "No rinsing".
# 6. Activate the "start_pause_control" feature and set variable_start_running to "start".

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_program = "P3 (Speedy)"
# - variable_water_level = 35
# - variable_washing_time = 6
# - variable_rinse_type = "No rinsing"
# - variable_start_running = "start"
