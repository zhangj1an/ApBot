# The current code accurately models the washer's features described in the user manual to handle the user command.
# Here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "turn_power_on_off" to turn on the washer.
# 2. "set_program" to choose the 'Gentle' program.
# 3. "set_load_size" to set the load size to medium.
# 4. "adjust_wash_time" to set the wash time to 10 minutes.
# 5. "adjust_rinse_times" to set the rinse times to 1.
# 6. "adjust_spin_time" to set the spin time to 4 minutes.
# 7. "start_pause_operation" to begin the washing.

# Relevant user manual text and feature mapping:
# Step 1: "Power on your washer" - Feature: "turn_power_on_off".
# "Press this button to select your desired washing program" - Feature: "set_program".

# "Continuously pressing the spin button to select the spin time" - Feature: "adjust_spin_time".
# Step 5: "Press the START/PAUSE button to start the washing cycle" - Feature: "start_pause_operation".

# Corresponding goal variable values:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_program = "Gentle"
# variable_load_size = "2---medium"
# variable_wash_time = 10
# variable_rinse_times = 1
# variable_spin_time = 4
# variable_start_running = "on"
