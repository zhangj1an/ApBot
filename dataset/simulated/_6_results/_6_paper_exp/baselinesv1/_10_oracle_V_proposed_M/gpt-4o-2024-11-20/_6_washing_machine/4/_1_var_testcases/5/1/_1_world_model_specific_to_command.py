# The given code is accurate for simulating the described user command. 
# Below is the sequence of features required to achieve this command:

# 1. Feature: "power_control"
#    - Action: Turn on the machine.
#    - Relevant variable: variable_power_on_off
#    - Goal value: "on"
#    - User manual: "Press this button to switch power on and off." 

# 2. Feature: "select_program"
#    - Action: Choose the "Tub Clean" program (P6).
#    - Relevant variable: variable_program
#    - Goal value: "P6 (Tub Clean)"
#    - User manual: "Selects programs. The program changes each time the button is pressed."

# 3. Feature: "adjust_water_level"
#    - Action: Set water level to the maximum (59L).
#    - Relevant variable: variable_water_level
#    - Goal value: 59L
#    - User manual: "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."

# 4. Feature: "adjust_rinse_type"
#    - Action: Set rinse type to "Normal Rinse 1 time."
#    - Relevant variable: variable_rinse_type
#    - Goal value: "Normal Rinse 1 time"
#    - User manual: "You can set the number and type of rinses by pressing the Rinse button. Each time you press the Rinse button the setting changes in sequence, from Normal Rinse 2 times, Water-Injection Rinse 2 times, no rinsing, Normal Rinse 1 time, Water-Injection Rinse 1 time."

# 5. Feature: "adjust_washing_time"
#    - Action: Set washing time to 3 minutes.
#    - Relevant variable: variable_washing_time
#    - Goal value: 3 minutes

#    - Relevant variable: variable_start_running
#    - Goal value: "start"
#    - User manual: "Press Start/Pause button. Starts and pauses operation."

# Given that all the features required to implement the user command are already accurately modeled in the provided code, we donâ€™t need to add or modify any features in the current implementation. Below, we retain the existing Simulator functionality as it is.
