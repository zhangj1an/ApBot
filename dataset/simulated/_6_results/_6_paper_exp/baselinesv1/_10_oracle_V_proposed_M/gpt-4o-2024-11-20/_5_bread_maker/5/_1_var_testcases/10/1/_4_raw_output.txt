Feedback Variable: 

 variable_menu_index: 1 basic 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the given feedback:

Goal State:
- `variable_menu_index` = "1"

Feedback:
- `variable_menu_index` = "1 basic"

---

### Analysis using the rules:

1. **Compare the values only**:
   - The goal value is "1", and the feedback value is "1 basic".

2. **Rule 2 (Capitalization/Textual Formatting)**:
   - The feedback contains "1 basic", which has additional text ("basic") compared to the goal value ("1"). This rule does not apply directly since there is a mismatch in textual content.

3. **Rule 3 (Remove Text and Compare Numbers)**:
   - Removing the text "basic" from the feedback, the numeric component of the feedback is "1", which matches the goal value "1". Thus, semantically, the feedback aligns with the goal.

4. **Rule 5 (Better Matching Option)**:
   - If "1" is the best possible option in the variable range for `variable_menu_index`, then "1 basic" can be considered equivalent since no better match exists. The feedback does not contradict the goal.

5. **Rule 6 (Combination of Variable Name and Value)**:
   - The combination "variable_menu_index: 1 basic" semantically implies the program is set to menu index "1". This matches the goal.

---

### Conclusion:

reason = "The feedback value '1 basic' semantically matches the goal value '1' when the text is removed, and no better matching value exists in the variable range. Therefore, the goal is considered reached."

Comparison result: 

 reason = "The goal state requires the variable_menu_index to have a value of '1'. The feedback shows 'variable_menu_index: 1 basic'. According to Rule 4, if the goal string is purely a number, we can ignore any accompanying text in the feedback. After removing the text 'basic', the feedback value is '1', which matches the goal state value of '1'. Thus, the pair matches."
