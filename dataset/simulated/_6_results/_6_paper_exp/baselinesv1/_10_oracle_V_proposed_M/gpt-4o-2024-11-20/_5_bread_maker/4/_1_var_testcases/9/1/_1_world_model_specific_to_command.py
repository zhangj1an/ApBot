# Python Comments: The code has not currently missed out any essential features or variables described in the user manual that are required to fulfill the given user command. All the necessary variables (like `variable_menu_index`, `variable_crust_colour`, `variable_loaf_size`, `variable_gluten_free_mode`, `variable_timer_setting`, and `variable_start_running`) and features (e.g., "set_auto_menu", "set_crust_color", "set_loaf_size", "set_gluten_free_mode", "set_timer", and "start_or_cancel") to achieve the task are well-modelled.

# Sequence of Features Needed:
# 1. "set_auto_menu": Select the "Sweet" menu.
# 2. "set_crust_color": Set the crust color to "Medium".
# 3. "set_loaf_size": Select the loaf size to "900g".
# 4. "set_timer": Delay the starting time by 3 hours.
# 5. "set_gluten_free_mode": Enable gluten-free mode.
# 6. "start_or_cancel": Start the bread maker.

# Relevant user manual text excerpts:
# - "Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen."
# - "To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark (and Rapid) on the display screen."
# - "To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen."

# - "set_crust_color"
# - "set_loaf_size"
# - "set_timer"
# - "set_gluten_free_mode"

# Goal Variable Values:
# - `variable_menu_index` = "Sweet"
# - `variable_crust_colour` = "Medium"
# - `variable_loaf_size` = "900g"
# - `variable_timer_setting` = 10800 (3 hours in seconds)
# - `variable_gluten_free_mode` = "on"
# - `variable_start_running` = "on"
