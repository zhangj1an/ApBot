# Python Comments:
# The given code correctly models the appliance feature needed for the user command.
# Below is the sequence of features needed to achieve the command according to the code and user manual:
#

#    - User manual: "Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program."
#    - Feature: "start_or_cancel"
#
# 2. Set the Basic menu ("variable_menu_index").
#    - User manual: "Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen."
#    - Feature: "set_auto_menu"
#
# 3. Set the crust color to Rapid ("variable_crust_colour").

#
# 4. Set the loaf size to 680g ("variable_loaf_size").
#    - User manual: "To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen."
#    - Feature: "set_loaf_size"
#
# 5. Set a 3-hour delay using the timer ("variable_timer_setting").
#    - User manual: "Press TIMER up arrow or down arrow to increase or decrease start time."
#    - Feature: "set_timer"

#    - User manual: "Press the GLUTEN FREE button on the control panel. GLUTEN FREE will display on the screen."
#    - Feature: "set_gluten_free_mode"
#
# Here is the goal variable values to achieve the command:

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator):
    pass

# Goal variable values for the command
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_start_running": "on",
    "variable_menu_index": "Basic",
