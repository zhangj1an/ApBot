Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is press_color_button. The first observed action is press_color_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_crust_color is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['DARK', 'LIGHT', 'MEDIUM']. The current value is MEDIUM.

# The variable variable_crust_color is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['DARK', 'LIGHT', 'MEDIUM']. The current value is MEDIUM.  

# After debugging, evidence shows that the order of the values in the value range is wrong. 
# The correct order based on observed transitions is ['MEDIUM', 'LIGHT', 'DARK'].

Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is press_plus_button. The first observed action is press_plus_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_delay_time is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '10', '11', '12', '13', '0']. The current value is 0.
