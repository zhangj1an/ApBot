The effective action is press_loaf_size_button. The first observed action is press_loaf_size_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_loaf_size is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['1.5-lb', '2-lb']. The current value is 2-lb.

Feedback Variable: 

 variable_delay_timer: 12 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the given goal state and the feedback using the rules provided:

**Goal State:**  
`variable_delay_timer = 180` (The number represents minutes.)

**Feedback:**  
`variable_delay_timer = 12`

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Compare the variable names:**  
   The variable names are the same (`variable_delay_timer`), so we proceed to compare the values.

2. **Compare the values:**  
   - The goal value is `180`, and the feedback value is `12`.  
   - Both values represent time in minutes.  
   - Since `12` is not equal to `180`, and there is no textual ambiguity or formatting issue, the values do not match.

3. **Check for better matching options in the variable range:**  
   - The goal specifies `variable_delay_timer` should be set to `180`.  
   - There is no indication of other possible valid values that might match better.  
   - Since `12` is not the intended value, the goal has not been reached.

---

### Final Decision:

**reason:** "The feedback value of 12 minutes does not match the goal value of 180 minutes for the variable_delay_timer. Both values represent time, but they are numerically different, and the goal has not been reached."  
**goal_reached:** False

Comparison result: 

 reason = "The goal state requires 'variable_delay_timer' to have a value of 180, while the feedback shows 'variable_delay_timer' with a value of 12. Since both values represent time, they should be compared using the same unit (minutes). The goal value (180 minutes) is not equal to the feedback value (12 minutes), and there is no better matching option in the variable range that aligns with the goal value. Hence, the goal has not been reached."
