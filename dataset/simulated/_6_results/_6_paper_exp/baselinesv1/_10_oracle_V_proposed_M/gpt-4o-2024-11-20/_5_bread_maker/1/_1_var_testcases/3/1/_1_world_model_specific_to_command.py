# The requested command is to bake a whole wheat bread with a light crust, loaf size is 1.5lb, set the delay timer to 4 hours from now and start the bread maker.

# Below I confirm that the current code correctly models the relevant appliance features to achieve the user command:

# 1. **Set Menu:** Select the "Whole Wheat" bread program:
#    - User Manual Text: "The Menu button is used to select a program. Each time it is pressed, the program will vary. Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the 12 programs on the LCD display. Select your desired program. 3. WHOLE WHEAT: Kneading, rising and baking of whole wheat bread. It is not advisable to use the delay function as this can produce poor results."
#    - Feature in Code: `feature_list["set_menu"]`.

# 2. **Set Crust Color:** Choose the "Light" crust:
#    - User Manual Text: "Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust."
#    - Feature in Code: `feature_list["set_crust_color"]`.

# 3. **Set Loaf Size:** Select 1.5LB:
#    - User Manual Text: "Press this button to select the desired size of the loaf."
#    - Feature in Code: `feature_list["set_loaf_size"]`.

# 4. **Set Delay Timer:**
#    - User Manual Text: "Use this button to delay the start time for your desired program. Begin by determining when a freshly baked loaf of bread is desired, then press the “+” and “–” buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments. Maximum delay time is 13 hours."
#    - Feature in Code: `feature_list["adjust_delay_time"]`.

# 5. **Start Bread Maker:**
#    - User Manual Text: "To start a program, press the START/STOP button once."
#    - Feature in Code: `feature_list["start_or_stop_bread_maker"]`.

# Based on the user manual and mapped feature list, the existing implementation accurately models all relevant features needed to achieve the command. No modifications are required.

# Below is the ExtendedSimulator demonstrating no changes:

# To achieve the requested command, you can use the following sequence of actions:
# Sequence of Features:
#   1. "set_menu" - Set "Whole Wheat" bread program.
#   2. "set_crust_color" - Set crust color to "Light".
#   3. "set_loaf_size" - Set loaf size to "1.5LB".
#   4. "adjust_delay_time" - Set delay timer to "240 minutes" (4 hours).
#   5. "start_or_stop_bread_maker" - Start the bread maker.

# Goal Variable Values:
#   - variable_menu_index: "Whole Wheat" (via `feature_list["set_menu"]`).
#   - variable_crust_color: "Light" (via `feature_list["set_crust_color"]`).
#   - variable_loaf_size: "1.5LB" (via `feature_list["set_loaf_size"]`).
#   - variable_delay_time: 240 (via `feature_list["adjust_delay_time"]`).
#   - variable_start_running: "on" (via `feature_list["start_or_stop_bread_maker"]`).
