# Python comments with step by step verification of the current code:
# 1. The user command specifies setting the crust color to "Medium", which matches the current code.
#    The crust color variable (variable_crust_color) and its related feature (adjust_crust_color) are correctly implemented.
#    User manual reference: "*Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed).*"
#    Feature list name: "adjust_crust_color"

# 2. The user command specifies selecting the "Quick" program. This is modeled using "variable_menu_index"
#    and the feature "set_program_menu," which allows choosing one of the 12 programs.
#    User manual reference: "*Choose a Programme with the MENU button.*"
#    Feature list name: "set_program_menu"

# 3. The user command specifies choosing a loaf size of 900g. This is modeled using the variable 
#    "variable_loaf_size" and the feature "adjust_loaf_size."
#    User manual reference: "*Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed).*"
#    Feature list name: "adjust_loaf_size"

# 4. The user command specifies setting the delay timer to 2 hours (120 minutes).
#    The delay timer variable (variable_delay_timer) is modeled with a continuous range of values from 0 to 720 minutes.
#    This is implemented in the feature "adjust_delay_timer."
#    User manual reference: "*The time delay function allows you to delay the start time of the baking by up to 12 hours.*"
#    Feature list name: "adjust_delay_timer"

# 5. The user command specifies powering on and starting the appliance. While the code includes a variable for 
#    start/stop functionality (variable_start_running), its associated feature (start_stop_appliance) toggles between "on" and "off."
#    This aligns with the described operation, and no modification is needed.
#    User manual reference: "*Press START/STOP button to start or stop the Programmes.*"
#    Feature list name: "start_stop_appliance"

# Current code maps perfectly to the user command and no new features, variables, or action modifications are required.
