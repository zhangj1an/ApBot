# The given code has correctly modelled the features required to achieve the command to "Bake Whole Grain Bread. Set the cycle to 'Whole Grain'. Choose 'Dark' crust color. Choose loaf size '2-lb'. Set the delay timer to 4 hours. Start the bread maker." The sequence of features and actions required to accomplish the task is as follows:

# **Sequence of Features Needed**:
# 1. Select the cycle:
#    - User manual: Press CYCLE button to select your desired cycle. The corresponding cycle number is shown on the display.
#    - Feature list: "select_cycle" -> Adjust 'variable_cycle'.
#    - Goal variable: Set `variable_cycle` to "Whole Grain".

# 2. Select the crust color:
#    - User manual: Press CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust.
#    - Feature list: "select_crust_color" -> Adjust 'variable_crust_color'.
#    - Goal variable: Set `variable_crust_color` to "Dark".

# 3. Select the loaf size:
#    - User manual: Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size.
#    - Feature list: "select_loaf_size" -> Adjust 'variable_loaf_size'.
#    - Goal variable: Set `variable_loaf_size` to "2.0lb".

# 4. Set the delay timer:
#    - User manual: Use the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time. Press the + and â€“ buttons to increase the cycle time shown on the display.
#    - Feature list: "set_delay_timer" -> Adjust 'variable_delay_timer'.
#    - Goal variable: Set `variable_delay_timer` to 240 (4 hours = 240 minutes).

# 5. Start the bread maker:
#    - User manual: Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle.
#    - Feature list: "start_stop_operation" -> Adjust 'variable_start_running'.
#    - Goal variable: Set `variable_start_running` to "on".

# **Goal Variable Values**:
# - `variable_cycle`: "Whole Grain"
# - `variable_crust_color`: "Dark"
# - `variable_loaf_size`: "2.0lb"
# - `variable_delay_timer`: 240
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
