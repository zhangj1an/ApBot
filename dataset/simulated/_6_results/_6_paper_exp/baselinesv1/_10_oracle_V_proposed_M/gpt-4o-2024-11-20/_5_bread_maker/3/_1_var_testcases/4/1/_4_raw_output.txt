Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is press_loaf_size_button. The first observed action is press_loaf_size_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_loaf_size is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['1.5-lb', '2-lb']. The current value is 2-lb.

Attempt 1: Trying to update variable definition.
Updated Variable code: # The variable variable_loaf_size is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['1.5-lb', '2-lb']. The current value is 2-lb.  

# Correcting the variable definition for consistency with observed value ranges and adjusting its value
variable_loaf_size = DiscreteVariable(
    value_range=["1.5-lb", "2-lb"],  # Correct the value range as '1.5-lb' matches observed values
    current_value="2-lb"  # Set the initial value to 2-lb as per analysis

Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is press_delay_timer_plus_button. The first observed action is press_delay_timer_plus_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_delay_timer is ContinuousVariable with value ranges and step values to be [[0, 13, 1]]. The current value is 0.

Attempt 1: Trying to update variable definition.
Updated Variable code: # The variable variable_delay_timer is ContinuousVariable with value ranges and step values to be [[0, 13, 1]]. The current value is 0.
