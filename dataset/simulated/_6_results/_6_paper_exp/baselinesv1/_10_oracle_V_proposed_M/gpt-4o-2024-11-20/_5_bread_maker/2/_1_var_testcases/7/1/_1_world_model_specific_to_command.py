# Python comments:
# The current code accurately models all appliance variables and features needed to achieve the user command:
# Setting the bread maker for a large, light-crust dough using the dough setting for a timer delay of 3 hours and then starting the bread maker.
# Below is the sequence of steps and the corresponding features needed to achieve this command:
#
# 1. Choose the dough program by setting the menu to "8 Dough". (Feature: "set_menu")
#    User Manual: "Menu button: For choosing the bread-making program from the list 1 to 12."
#
# 2. Select light crust. (Feature: "adjust_crust_color")
#    User Manual: "Colour button: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
#
# 3. Set the loaf size to large (2lb). (Feature: "adjust_loaf_size")
#    User Manual: "Loaf size button: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)."
#
# 4. Set the timer delay to 3 hours using the time adjustment buttons. (Feature: "adjust_timer")
#    User Manual: "Timer delay buttons: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)."
#
# 5. Start the bread maker. (Feature: "start_stop")
#    User Manual: "Start: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds, and the colon (:) flashes, and the program starts."

# Based on the above analysis and required steps, the current code is complete and sufficient for the task. The goal variable values are:
# - variable_menu_index = "8 Dough"
# - variable_crust_color = "light"
# - variable_loaf_size = "2lb"
# - variable_timer_delay = 180 (3 hours, represented in minutes)
# - variable_start_running = "on"
