# Python comments explaining the steps needed according to the given code to achieve the command:

# To achieve the command "Prepare Quick Whole Grain Breakfast Bread. Set the cycle to 'Quick'.
# Choose 'Light' crust color. Choose loaf size '1.5-lb'. Set the delay timer to 2 hours.
# Start the bread maker," the following sequence of features is required:

# 1. Feature to set the cycle to 'Quick':
#    - Feature: select_cycle
#    - User Manual Text: "Press CYCLE button to select your desired cycle. The corresponding cycle number is shown on the display."
#    - Code Feature: feature_list["select_cycle"]
#    - Goal Variable Value: variable_cycle.set_current_value("Quick")

# 2. Feature to set the crust color to 'Light':
#    - Feature: select_crust_color
#    - User Manual Text: "Press CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust."
#    - Code Feature: feature_list["select_crust_color"]
#    - Goal Variable Value: variable_crust_color.set_current_value("Light")

# 3. Feature to set the loaf size to '1.5-lb':
#    - Feature: select_loaf_size
#    - User Manual Text: "Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size."
#    - Code Feature: feature_list["select_loaf_size"]
#    - Goal Variable Value: variable_loaf_size.set_current_value("1.5lb")

# 4. Feature to set the delay timer to 2 hours (120 minutes):
#    - Feature: set_delay_timer
#    - User Manual Text: "Use the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time. Press the + and â€“ buttons."
#    - Code Feature: feature_list["set_delay_timer"]
#    - Goal Variable Value: variable_delay_timer.set_current_value(120)

# 5. Feature to start the bread maker:
#    - Feature: start_stop_operation
#    - User Manual Text: "Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle."
#    - Code Feature: feature_list["start_stop_operation"]
#    - Goal Variable Value: variable_start_running.set_current_value("on")

# All features and their respective actions involved in this command are already implemented correctly in the given code.

# Goal variable values for this command:
# variable_cycle = "Quick"
# variable_crust_color = "Light"
# variable_loaf_size = "1.5lb"
# variable_delay_timer = 120
# variable_start_running = "on"
