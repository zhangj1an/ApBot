# The provided code seems to accurately model the features and actions necessary to accomplish the given user command:
# Prepare basic bread with dark crust size 2LB for dinner, set the timer to 6 hours from now, and start the bread maker.

# Below is the analysis:
# 1. To achieve this, the sequence of features needed are: "set_menu", "set_crust_color", "set_loaf_size", "adjust_delay_time", and "start_or_stop_bread_maker".
# 2. The corresponding variables are:
#    - Set `variable_menu_index` to "Basic" (via "set_menu").
#    - Set `variable_crust_color` to "Dark" (via "set_crust_color").
#    - Set `variable_loaf_size` to "2.0LB" (via "set_loaf_size").
#    - Set `variable_delay_time` to 360 minutes (6 hours in minutes) (via "adjust_delay_time").
#    - Set `variable_start_running` to "on" (via "start_or_stop_bread_maker").

# Relevant user manual text:
# - "MENU: The Menu button is used to select a program. Each time it is pressed, the program will vary. Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the 12 programs on the LCD display. Select your desired program..."
# - "COLOR: Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust."
# - "LOAF SIZE: Press this button to select the desired size of the loaf."
# - "DELAY FUNCTION: Use this button to delay the start time for your desired program. Begin by determining when a freshly baked loaf of bread is desired, then press the '+' and 'â€“' buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments. Maximum delay time is 13 hours."
# - "START/STOP: This button is used for starting and stopping the selected baking program."

# Feature list in given code:
# - "set_menu"
# - "set_crust_color"
# - "set_loaf_size"
# - "adjust_delay_time"
# - "start_or_stop_bread_maker"

# Since the code already implements these features and variables correctly:
# Feature "set_menu" models setting the program.
# Feature "set_crust_color" models setting the crust color.
# Feature "set_loaf_size" models setting the loaf size.
# Feature "adjust_delay_time" models setting the timer delay.
# Feature "start_or_stop_bread_maker" models toggling start/stop.

# Thus, the code sufficiently supports achieving the command. Define the goal variable values:

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.goal_variable_values = {
            "variable_menu_index": "Basic",
            "variable_crust_color": "Dark",
            "variable_loaf_size": "2.0LB",
            "variable_delay_time": 360,
            "variable_start_running": "on",
        }
