# The given code has successfully included relevant features and variables to model the appliance commands.
# Here's the sequence of features needed to achieve the command from the user:

# Feature sequence:
# 1. Feature: "set_program_menu" - Select the "Sweet" program (Menu 5 as per the user manual).
#    Corresponding feature in the code: feature_list["set_program_menu"]
#    User manual: "Press the MENU button to cycle through 12 program menus."

# 2. Feature: "adjust_loaf_size" - Choose a loaf size of 700g.
#    Corresponding feature in the code: feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
#    User manual: "Press the LOAF SIZE button to select different sizes of bread (700g or 900g)."

# 3. Feature: "adjust_crust_color" - Set the crust color to "Medium".
#    Corresponding feature in the code: feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
#    User manual: "Press COLOR button to choose the desired crust colour: Light, Medium or Dark."

# 4. Feature: "adjust_delay_timer" - Set the delay timer to 4 hours.
#    Corresponding feature in the code: feature_list["adjust_delay_timer"]
#    User manual: "Use the DELAY TIMER buttons to delay the start time of baking by up to 12 hours."

# 5. Feature: "start_stop_appliance" - Power on and start the bread maker operation.
#    Corresponding feature in the code: feature_list["start_stop_appliance"]
#    User manual: "Press START/STOP button to start or stop the Programmes."

# Setting the goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "5" for selecting the Sweet program.
# - Set `variable_loaf_size` to "700g".
# - Set `variable_crust_color` to "Medium".
# - Set `variable_delay_timer` to 240 (4 hours in minutes).
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".

# Therefore, the given code already accurately models these functionalities as described in the user manual.
# Below is the extended simulator with no modifications, as the original implementation supports the required user command.
