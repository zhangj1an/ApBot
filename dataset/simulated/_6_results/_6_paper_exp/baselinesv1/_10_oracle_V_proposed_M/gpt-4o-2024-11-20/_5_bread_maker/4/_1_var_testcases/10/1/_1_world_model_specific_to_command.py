# Python comments explaining the evaluation:
# The requested user command aligns with several features already included in the provided code.
# The following features from the provided code will be used to achieve the command:
# 
# - Feature: "set_auto_menu" is used to select the French bread menu. (variable_menu_index)
#   - User manual reference: "Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen."
# - Feature: "set_crust_color" is used to set the crust color to medium. (variable_crust_colour)
#   - User manual reference: "To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark on the display screen."
# - Feature: "set_loaf_size" is used to adjust the loaf size to 900g. (variable_loaf_size)
#   - User manual reference: "To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen."
# - Feature: "set_timer" is used to set the delay timer to 3 hours. (variable_timer_setting)
#   - User manual reference: "The time displayed represents the finishing time... The time can be delayed by up to 15 hours."
# - Feature: "set_gluten_free_mode" enables the gluten-free setting. (variable_gluten_free_mode)
#   - User manual reference: "Press the GLUTEN FREE button on the control panel. GLUTEN FREE will display on the screen."
# - Feature: "start_or_cancel" is used to start the appliance. (variable_start_running)
#   - User manual reference: "Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program."
# 
# Based on the user manual and provided code, no changes are necessary.
# The feature implementation already supports the required steps.
