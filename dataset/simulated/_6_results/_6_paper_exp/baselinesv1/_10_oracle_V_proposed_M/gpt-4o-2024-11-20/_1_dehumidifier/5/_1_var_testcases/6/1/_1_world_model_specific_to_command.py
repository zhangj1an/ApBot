# User Command: Turn the dehumidifier on and adjust the fan speed to 'mid.'

# Relevant features and variables with confirmation:
# Raw User Manual Text:
# 1. Power Button (ON/OFF): Turns the unit on and off.
# 2. Fan/Air Speed (SPEED): 1.Low 2.Mid 3.High
# Confirmed relevant features already in the code:
# Feature to toggle power: feature_list["toggle_power"]
# Feature to adjust fan speed: feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"]

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use feature_list["toggle_power"] to turn the device on (set variable_power_on_off to "on").
# 2. Use feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"] to set the fan speed to "2" (representing 'mid').

# The current code correctly models these features and includes the necessary steps and variables to accomplish the task.
