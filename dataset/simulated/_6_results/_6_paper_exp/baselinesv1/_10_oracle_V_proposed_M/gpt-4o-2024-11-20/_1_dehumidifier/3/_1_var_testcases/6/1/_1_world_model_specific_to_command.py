# The given code correctly models the features relevant to the user command. Both activating the power (variable_power_on_off) and setting the fan speed/mode to "Sleep" (variable_fan_speed_mode) are implemented. 
# 
# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "power_on_off" (to turn on the air purifier)
# 2. "fan_speed_mode_control" (to set the fan mode to "Sleep")
#
# Relevant user manual text:
# - **Power Button:** Turn air purifier on and off.
# - **Fan Speed/Mode:** Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo and Auto mode, and Sleep mode.
#
# Feature list name in the given code:
# - Feature "power_on_off"
# - Feature "fan_speed_mode_control"
#
# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - `variable_power_on_off` = "on"
# - `variable_fan_speed_mode` = "Sleep"
