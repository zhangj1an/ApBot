# After reviewing the given code and user manual, some features were not modeled correctly to handle the request accurately. 
# Specifically, the user manual does not mention a "Start Running" or dehumidifier-specific function. Additionally, 
# there is no indication that the appliance itself explicitly handles a "dehumidifier" feature. However, the "power_on_off" 
# and "adjust_timer" features are sufficient to engage the appliance and set a timer.

# The provided code does appear accurate based on the user manual for power on/off operations, timer settings, 
# and other modeled features (e.g., fan speed and modes). My recommendation is to use the correct sequence of existing features.

# Sequence of Features Needed to Fulfill the User Command:
# 1. Power on the appliance: This utilizes the "power_on_off" feature.
# 2. Set the timer to "8H": This uses the "adjust_timer" feature.

# Corresponding raw user manual text:
# - Power On Appliance: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# - Adjust Timer: "The air purifier can be set to operate for timed intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours, stopping automatically when the selected operating time has elapsed."

# Name of feature lists referenced in the given code:
# - "power_on_off" for turning the unit on/off.
# - "adjust_timer" for setting the operating timer.

# Goal Variable Values:
# - `variable_power_on_off` = "on" (to power on the appliance).
# - `variable_timer` = "8H" (to set the timer to operate overnight).
