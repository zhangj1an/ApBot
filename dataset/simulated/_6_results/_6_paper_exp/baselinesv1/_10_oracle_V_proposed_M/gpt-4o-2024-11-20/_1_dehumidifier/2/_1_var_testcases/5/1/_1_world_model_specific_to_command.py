# Based on the user command "Switch on the dehumidifier and change the fan speed to LOW," 
# the given code already models the relevant appliance features needed to accomplish this task.

# The sequence of operations to achieve the command is:

# - For fan speed control: "**Fan speed settings** desired fan speed ('High', 'Medium', 'Low', or 'Auto') by pressing the 'Fan Speed' button."

# Relevant features in the provided code:
# - feature_list["power_on_off"]: [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_on_off_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]
# - feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"]: [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_speed_uv_button"], "variable": "variable_fan_speed"}]
