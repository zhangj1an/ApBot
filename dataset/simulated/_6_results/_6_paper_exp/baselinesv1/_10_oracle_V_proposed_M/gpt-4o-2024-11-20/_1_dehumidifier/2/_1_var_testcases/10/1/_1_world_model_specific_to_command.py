# The current code already captures the required features to achieve the command of starting the dehumidifier and setting the programmable timer to 12 hours. 

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this functionality is: 
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn on the dehumidifier (`variable_power_on_off` set to "on").
# 2. Use the "adjust_timer_setting" feature to set the timer to 12 hours (`variable_timer_setting` set to 12).

# Relevant raw user manual text:
# 1. "**01. Power On/Off**: Connect power plug to the power supply. The display screen illuminates with ..., indicating the unit is on standby mode, ready to be switched on anytime. Press the ‚èª button to turn on/off the unit."
# 2. "**07. Programmable Timer**: Unit is equipped with a programmable timer for an automatic turn-on or turn-off. When the unit is operating, press the [Timer] button and the timer hours start to flash on the display screen. Press the [Timer] button consecutively to select your preferred timer duration from 1 to 24 hours at an interval of 1 hour."

# The corresponding features in the code:
# 1. "power_on_off" feature manages the on/off state of the dehumidifier through the `press_on_off_button` action to toggle `variable_power_on_off`.
# 2. "adjust_timer_setting" feature allows adjustment of `variable_timer_setting` using the `press_timer_button` action.

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_timer_setting` to 12.
