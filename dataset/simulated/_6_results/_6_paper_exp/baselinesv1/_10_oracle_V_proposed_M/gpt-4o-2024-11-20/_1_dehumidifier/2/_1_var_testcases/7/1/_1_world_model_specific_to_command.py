# User manual text: 
# "Press the ‚èª button to turn on/off the unit."
# "Press the mode button consecutively until the unit display screen shows the followings."
# "Under Smart Mode, unit automatically selects the operating mode in accordance to the surrounding temperature."

# In the given code, the requested user command to turn on the dehumidifier and set the operating mode to SMART can be completed using the following feature steps:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn the appliance on, modeled by the feature_list["power_on_off"].
# 2. Use the "adjust_mode" feature to set the operating mode to SMART, modeled by the feature_list["adjust_mode"].

# The relevant user manual descriptions have been correctly modeled into features with all required actions and variables:
# - "power_on_off": models turning the power on/off.
# - "adjust_mode": encompasses selecting different modes, including SMART.

# The sequence of features required to achieve the user command:
# 1. "power_on_off": toggle `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. "adjust_mode": toggle `variable_mode` to "SMART".

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_mode`: "SMART"
