# The user manual clearly describes the necessary steps for activating the dehumidifier (powering on) and setting the timer to 8 hours. 
# According to the provided code, these functionalities are already accurately modeled:

# 1. Power On:
#    User manual: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."
#    Corresponding feature: `power_on_off`:
#    
#    This corresponds to toggling the `variable_power_on_off`, which is initially "off", to "on".

# 2. Timer Setting:
#    User manual: "Timer Button: Time can be selected from 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours."
#    Corresponding feature: `set_timer`:
#    
#    This corresponds to adjusting `variable_timer` to include the 8-hour option through cycling via the `press_timer_button`.

# Since these features are accurately modeled and implemented in the given `Simulator`, no modifications to the code are required to execute this command.

# Sequence of features needed:
#    1. `power_on_off` to activate the appliance.
#    2. `set_timer` to set the timer to 8 hours.

# Goal variable values:
#    - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
#    - `variable_timer`: "8H"
