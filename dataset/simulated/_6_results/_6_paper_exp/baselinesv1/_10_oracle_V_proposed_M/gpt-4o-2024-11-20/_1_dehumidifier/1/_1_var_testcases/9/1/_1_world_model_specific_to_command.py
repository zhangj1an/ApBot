# The existing code already accurately models the appliance functionality required to activate the dehumidifier and set it to ventilation mode. 
# The relevant feature_list names from the given code are as follows:
# - "power_on_off" feature models the activation of the dehumidifier.
# - "mode_selection" feature models changing the mode to "ventilation."

# Raw user manual text descriptions that support this modeling:
# - For "power_on_off": "Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation."
# - For "mode_selection": "MODE: select auto dehumidification, Continuous dehumidification, Drying clothes, purification and ventilation, etc."

# Sequence of steps to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to activate the dehumidifier.
# 2. Use the "mode_selection" feature to set the mode to "ventilation."

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on."
# - Set `variable_mode_selection` to "ventilation."
