# The following features correctly handle the user command to turn on the appliance and engage the 'night_mode'.

# Raw user manual excerpts:
# 1. "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
#    Corresponding feature: "power_on_off"
# 2. "The Microbe Shield™ and Night Modes utilize the same button on the control panel. 
#    Pressing the (microbe shield) Microbe Shield™/NIGHT MODE button will cycle through these two settings."
#    Corresponding feature: "adjust_microbe_shield_night_mode"

# Sequence of features needed:
# 1. "power_on_off": Set the appliance power state to "on".
# 2. "adjust_microbe_shield_night_mode": Set the mode to "night_mode".

# Feature list from the code:
# feature_list["power_on_off"] and feature_list["adjust_microbe_shield_night_mode"] correctly model the variable
# settings and action steps to achieve the desired commands.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_microbe_shield_night_mode = "night_mode"
