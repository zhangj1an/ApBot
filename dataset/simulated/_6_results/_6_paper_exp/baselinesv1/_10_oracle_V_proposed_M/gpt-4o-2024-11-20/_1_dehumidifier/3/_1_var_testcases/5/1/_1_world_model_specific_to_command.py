# The current code correctly implements the necessary appliance variables and features required to achieve the user command: "Turn the dehumidifier on and adjust it to Auto mode for energy-efficient operation." 

# Here is why:

# 1. The "Power On/Off" feature is already present in the feature list as feature_list["power_on_off"]. 
#    This feature allows toggling the power state of the appliance:
#    
#    User Manual Reference: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."

# 2. The "Fan Speed/Mode Setting" feature is present in the feature list as feature_list["fan_speed_mode_control"]. 
#    This feature allows setting the fan speed or mode, including "Auto" mode:
#    
#    User Manual Reference: "Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo, Auto and Sleep mode."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# - Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn the appliance on.
# - Use the "fan_speed_mode_control" feature to adjust the fan mode to "Auto."

# Goal variable values:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_fan_speed_mode to "Auto".
