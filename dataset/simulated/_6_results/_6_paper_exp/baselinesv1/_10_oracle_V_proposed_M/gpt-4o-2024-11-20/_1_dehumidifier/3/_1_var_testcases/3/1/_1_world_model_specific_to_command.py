# Python comment with analysis of user command:
# To achieve the user command "Power on the dehumidifier, set the timer to 1 hour, and switch the fan to Turbo mode,"
# the following relevant features correspond to the detailed user manual text:
# 1. Power On/Off:
#    User Manual: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."
#    Feature List: feature_list["power_on_off"]
# 2. Timer Setting:
#    User Manual: "Timer Button: Time can be selected from 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours."
#    Feature List: feature_list["set_timer"]
# 3. Fan Speed/Mode Setting:
#    User Manual: "Fan Speed/Mode Button: Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo and Auto mode, and Sleep mode."
#    Feature List: feature_list["fan_speed_mode_control"]
# 
# The provided feature list already correctly models the relevant appliance functionalities. 
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is:
# 1) "power_on_off" to turn the dehumidifier on.
# 2) "set_timer" to set the timer to 1 hour.
# 3) "fan_speed_mode_control" to cycle the fan mode to Turbo.
# 
# Goal variable values for achieving the user command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_timer to "1H".
# - Set variable_fan_speed_mode to "Turbo".
