# The current user command - "Start the dehumidifier and switch to 'high' fan speed to quickly reduce humidity after a rainy day" is not fully achievable with the given code. The given code misses out on a feature to start the dehumidifier (dehumidification functionality), which is necessary to achieve this command. Below is the missing information quoted from the user manual:

# From the user manual:
# **OPERATING YOUR AIR PURIFIER**
# 1. **Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate.**
# 2. The air purifier will begin operation.
# 3. The air purifier will begin operation in the last setting selected, including Night mode and Timer.

# The user command implies a necessary variable and feature for starting the dehumidifier and maintaining its operational state, such as turning it "on" or "off". Therefore, I will create a new variable, feature, and adjust the action effects so that the dehumidifier functionality is explicitly modeled. Here's the corrected and extended code.

# Adding a variable to model whether the air purifier is actively running, creating a feature to toggle the dehumidifier state, and connecting it to existing functionality for fan speed manipulation.

variable_start_running = DiscreteVariable(value_range=["on", "off"], current_value="off")

updated_feature_list = feature_list

# Adding a new feature to start/stop running the dehumidifier
updated_feature_list["toggle_running"] = [
    {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button"], "variable": "variable_start_running"}
]

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator):
    def reset(self):
        super().reset()
        self.variable_start_running = variable_start_running  # Initializing new variable
        self.feature = Feature(feature_list=updated_feature_list, current_value=("empty", 1))  # Updating feature list

    def press_start_button(self):
        # Action to toggle starting the dehumidifier
        self.feature.update_progress("press_start_button")
        current_feature = self.feature.current_value[0]
        if current_feature == "toggle_running":
            # Flip the running state (toggle between on and off)
            if self.variable_start_running.get_current_value() == "off":
                self.variable_start_running.set_current_value("on")
            else:
