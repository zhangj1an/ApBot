Feedback Variable: 

 variable_cool_mode_temperature: 25 


Comparison result: 

 Let's evaluate the goal state and the given feedback using the rules provided.

**Goal State**:  
We want to have the variable: `variable_temperature_setting` to have a value of `24`.

**Feedback**:  
`variable_cool_mode_temperature: 25`

---

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Variable Name Comparison**:  
   - The variable names are already verified to represent the same item, so we only compare the values.

2. **Value Comparison**:  
   - **Goal value**: `24`
   - **Feedback value**: `25`
   - Both values are numbers. Since they are different (`24 ≠ 25`), the feedback does not match the goal value.

3. **Additional Context**:  
   - There is no indication that `25` is an acceptable or equivalent value to `24` in this context. Furthermore, there is no better matching option than `24` in the variable range based on the given information.

---

### Conclusion:

reason = "The feedback value '25' does not match the goal value '24'. Since the values differ numerically and there is no indication that '25' is equivalent to '24', the goal has not been reached."  
goal_reached = False

Attempt to update goal: round 1

Your previous attempt to modify variable_temperature_setting has the following result: 
goal_state.variable_temperature_setting.set_value_ranges([(0, 18, 18), (18, 32, 1)])
goal_state.variable_temperature_setting.set_current_value(24)
This results in an error: 'ContinuousVariable' object has no attribute 'set_value_ranges'. Please correct the error and try again.
