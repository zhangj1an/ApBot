# The current code from the Simulator correctly models the appliance features and actions described in the user manual. 
# The relevant features to achieve the command "Power on the dehumidifier and set the timer to '2H' to run it for two hours while you're out." are:
# Feature: "power_on_off" (to power on the dehumidifier).
# Feature: "adjust_timer" (to set the timer to '2H').

# Below are the relevant raw user manual texts and the current feature list:

# Raw User Manual Text for "power_on_off":
# "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."

# Feature: power_on_off
# feature_list["power_on_off"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]

# Raw User Manual Text for "adjust_timer":
# "The air purifier can be set to operate for timed intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours and 8 hours, stopping automatically when the selected operating time has elapsed."

# Feature: adjust_timer
# feature_list["adjust_timer"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_timer_button"], "variable": "variable_timer"}]

# To achieve the command, the sequence of features required are:
# 1. "power_on_off" to set the power to "on".
# 2. "adjust_timer" to set the timer to "2H".

# The goal variable values are:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_timer = "2H"
