# The given code already models the relevant appliance features to achieve the user command. 
# Here’s the sequence of features to fulfill the command along with corresponding features 
# and goal variable values:

# Sequence of features:
# 1. "adjust_upper_heater_temperature" to set the upper heater temperature to 110 °C.
# 2. "adjust_lower_heater_temperature" to set the lower heater temperature to 110 °C.
# 3. "adjust_timer" to set the timer to 100 minutes.
# 4. "select_function" to set the function knob to "Rotary/Upper Heater".

# Relevant user manual text:
# ● Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs: Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C
# ● Timer: 
#   - The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches "0".
#   - Tips: to set baking time less than 20 minutes, turn up the knob beyond 40 minutes then return 
#     to the desired time.
# ● Function knob:
#   □ Operates the lower heater
#   □ Operates the upper heater
#   □ Operates the lower & upper heater at the same time
#   ⌛ Convection (Lower & upper heater heating)
#   ↻ Rotary (Upper heater heating) Fermentation

# Matching feature_list names:
# - "adjust_upper_heater_temperature"
# - "adjust_lower_heater_temperature"
# - "adjust_timer"
# - "select_function"

# Goal variable values:
# - variable_upper_heater_temperature = 110
# - variable_lower_heater_temperature = 110
# - variable_timer = "100"
# - variable_function_knob = "Rotary"

# Since the current implementation already supports achieving the command, no modifications are required.
