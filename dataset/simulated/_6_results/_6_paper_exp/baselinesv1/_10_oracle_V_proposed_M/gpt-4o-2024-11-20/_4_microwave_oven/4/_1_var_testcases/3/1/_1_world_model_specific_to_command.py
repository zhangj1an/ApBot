# The current code correctly models the relevant appliance features needed to achieve the command as stated in the user-provided command. 
# Specifically, the features modelled in the code and their relevance are as follows:

"""
1. **"adjust_upper_heater_temperature" feature**:
   - Raw user manual text: "Upper heaters temperature knob: Temperature range - 70 °C to 230 °C."
   - Feature_list: "adjust_upper_heater_temperature"
   - This feature is needed to follow the command and set the upper heater temperature to "190 °C". 
     The `variable_upper_heater_temperature` is appropriately created with the correct value ranges and steps.

2. **"adjust_lower_heater_temperature" feature**:
   - Raw user manual text: "Lower heaters temperature knob: Temperature range - 70 °C to 230 °C."
   - Feature_list: "adjust_lower_heater_temperature"
   - This feature is needed to follow the command and set the lower heater temperature to "190 °C". 
     The `variable_lower_heater_temperature` is appropriately created with the correct value ranges and steps.

3. **"adjust_timer" feature**:
   - Raw user manual text: "The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches '0'. Tips: To set baking time less than 20 minutes, turn..." 
   - Feature_list: "adjust_timer"
   - This feature is needed to follow the command and set the timer to "40 minutes." 
     The `variable_timer` with discrete options including "40" is already created and appropriately adjustable.

4. **"select_function" feature**:
   - Raw user manual text: "Function knob: [Options: Lower heater, Upper heater, Lower & Upper heater, Convection, Rotary...]"
   - Feature_list: "select_function"
   - This feature is needed to follow the command and set the function knob to "Convection".
     The `variable_function_knob` is appropriately created with the correct value range including "Convection".
