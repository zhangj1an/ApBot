# The current code already correctly models the relevant appliance feature needed to achieve the user command:
# **Defrost using time defrost for 10 minutes with 60% power, then start the appliance.**

# We confirm that the following features in the current code enable achieving the command:
# 
# 1. **Feature Name**: "set_time_defrost" (Relevant steps are as follows):
#    - Step 1: Select time defrost mode. Action: "press_time_defrost_button".
#    - Step 2: Input defrosting time. Action: meta_actions_on_number. Variable: variable_time_defrost. Adjusted by parsing input string.
#    - Step 3: Adjust microwave power level for defrost. Action: "press_power_button".
#    - Step 4: Input power level. Action: meta_actions_on_number. Variable: variable_power.
#    - Step 5: Confirm and start defrost. Action: "press_start_plus_30sec_button".
#
# 2. The command can be achieved in steps as described in the current feature list:
#    a. Step 1: Enter the time_defrost feature by executing action `press_time_defrost_button`.
#    b. Step 2: Adjust `variable_time_defrost` to "10:00" using meta_actions_on_number with input string parsing (converted 10 minutes to "00:10:00").
#    c. Step 3: Adjust `variable_power` to "PL6" (input "6" parsed as "PL6").
#    d. Step 4: Start operation via `press_start_plus_30sec_button`, which sets `variable_start_running: on`.
#
# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - `variable_time_defrost`: "00:10:00" (10 minutes converted to HH:MM:SS format).
# - `variable_power`: "PL6" (60% power level).
# - `variable_start_running`: "on" (appliance starts running).
