Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is turn_function_selection_dial_clockwise. The first observed action is turn_function_selection_dial_clockwise.
Analysis results: The variable variable_function_selection is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['upper heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube with convection', 'upper heating tube with Rotisserie Motor', 'lower heating tube']. The current value is lower heating tube.

Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is turn_function_selection_dial_clockwise. The first observed action is turn_function_selection_dial_clockwise.
Analysis results: The variable variable_function_selection is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['upper heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube with convection', 'upper heating tube with Rotisserie Motor', 'lower heating tube']. The current value is lower heating tube.

Attempt 1: Trying to update variable definition.
Updated Variable code: # The variable variable_function_selection is DiscreteVariable with value ranges to be ['upper heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube with convection', 'upper heating tube with Rotisserie Motor', 'lower heating tube']. The current value is lower heating tube.  

variable_function_selection = DiscreteVariable(value_range=['upper heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube', 'upper and lower heating tube with convection', 'upper heating tube with Rotisserie Motor', 'lower heating tube'], current_value='lower heating tube')
