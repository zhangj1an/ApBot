# The given code is missing the inclusion of the feature or variable to start the microwave oven running after setting the desired values. 
# Specifically, the user manual mentions:
# "Heating will commence immediately" when the timer is set. However, this implies an automatic start after the timer is set, and there seems to be no explicit mention of an on/off functionality in the control panel in the user manual.
# Since there is no additional feature or button mentioned for starting/stopping the appliance manually, no modifications are necessary.

# To execute the given user command using the simulator provided:
# The relevant features are:
# 1. `adjust_function_dial` for setting the function dial to "Convection".
# 2. `adjust_temperature_dial` for setting the temperature dial to "150°C".
# 3. `adjust_selector_dial` for setting the selector dial to "Top & Bottom Heating".
# 4. `adjust_timer_dial` for setting the timer dial to "10 minutes".

# The feature steps and their respective feature list in the given code are:
# - Feature step: Adjust the function dial.
#   Feature list key: `adjust_function_dial`.
#   User action: Turn the function dial clockwise or anticlockwise.
# - Feature step: Adjust the temperature dial.
#   Feature list key: `adjust_temperature_dial`.
#   User action: Turn the temperature dial clockwise or anticlockwise.
# - Feature step: Adjust the selector dial.
#   Feature list key: `adjust_selector_dial`.
#   User action: Turn the selector dial clockwise or anticlockwise.
# - Feature step: Adjust the timer dial.
#   Feature list key: `adjust_timer_dial`.
#   User action: Turn the timer dial clockwise or anticlockwise.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# `variable_function_dial`: "Convection"
# `variable_temperature_dial`: "150°C"
# `variable_selector_dial`: "Top & Bottom Heating"
# `variable_timer_dial`: "10 minutes"
