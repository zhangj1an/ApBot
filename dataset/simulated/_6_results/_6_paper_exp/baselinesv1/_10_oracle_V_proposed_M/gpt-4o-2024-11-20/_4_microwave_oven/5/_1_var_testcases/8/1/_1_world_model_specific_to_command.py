# The code is missing an essential variable and feature for turning on the microwave oven to make it start functioning.
# As per the user manual, the appliance behavior indicates that it should begin heating upon adjusting and setting the timer.
# Additionally, there is no explicit mention of a power on/off button in the user manual.
# To correctly model the given user command, there is no immediate need to modify the variables or actions.
# The current code appears to already align with the user manual for the following commands:
# - Adjust the function dial to 'Convection'.
# - Adjust the temperature dial to '200째C'.
# - Adjust the selector dial to 'Top Heating'.
# - Adjust the timer dial to '30 minutes' (interpreted as 30).

# The sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. "adjust_function_dial" feature: Set variable_function_dial to "Convection".
# 2. "adjust_temperature_dial" feature: Set variable_temperature_dial to "200째C".
# 3. "adjust_selector_dial" feature: Set variable_selector_dial to "Top Heating".
# 4. "adjust_timer_dial" feature: Set variable_timer_dial to "30 minutes".

# Relevant user manual text:
# - "Turn the Function dial clockwise to the desired operation."
# - "Turn the Temperature dial clockwise to the 250째C setting."
# - "Turn the Selector dial clockwise to select top heating, bottom heating or both."
# - "Turn the Timer dial clockwise to the desired cooking duration. Heating will commence immediately."
# - "When the cooking time is over, the timer will auto shut off and the bell will ring."

# Corresponding feature list names in the given code:
# - feature_list["adjust_function_dial"]
# - feature_list["adjust_temperature_dial"]
# - feature_list["adjust_selector_dial"]
# - feature_list["adjust_timer_dial"]

# Goal variable values:
# - Set variable_function_dial to "Convection".
# - Set variable_temperature_dial to "200째C".
# - Set variable_selector_dial to "Top Heating".
# - Set variable_timer_dial to "30 minutes".
