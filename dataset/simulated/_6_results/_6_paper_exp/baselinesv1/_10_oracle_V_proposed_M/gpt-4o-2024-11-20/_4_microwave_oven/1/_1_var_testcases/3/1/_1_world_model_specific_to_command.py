# Python comments: The current code has correctly implemented the required variables and features described in the user manual
# and can adequately handle the user command. Below is the sequence to follow for this task:

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. Set Microwave Cooking Time and Power:
# - Feature name: "set_microwave_cook_time_power"
# - User manual text: "Example: to cook the food with 50% microwave power for 15 minutes:
# a. Press 'TIME COOK' once.'00:00' displays.
# b. Press '1', '5', '0', '0' in order.
# c. Press 'POWER' once, then press '5' to select 50% microwave power.
# d. Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start cooking."
# - Goal for this feature: Set variable_time_cook_time to "00:05:00" and variable_power to "PL7".

# 2. Start Cooking:
# - Feature name: "set_microwave_cook_time_power"
# - Goal for this feature: Press "press_start_plus_30sec_button" to set variable_start_running to "on".

# Goal Variable Values:
# variable_time_cook_time = "00:05:00"
# variable_power = "PL7"
# variable_start_running = "on"
