# The given code models the upper tube temperature adjustment, function selection, lower tube temperature adjustment, and time adjustment correctly. However, the user manual also indicates the oven can operate in different modes (e.g., the combination of upper and lower heating tubes, convection, etc.) during cooking. The feature for function selection already allows setting the correct cooking mode. Starting the oven is implicitly connected to time adjustment ("Stay On" mode). Here is the sequence of steps and related features to achieve the user's request:

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. Adjust the upper tube temperature (feature_list["adjust_upper_tube_temperature"]).
#    User manual: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking."
# 2. Select the cooking function as upper and lower tubes heating (feature_list["adjust_function_selection"]).
#    User manual: "Select cooking function. The upper and lower heating tubes work during this function."
# 3. Set the lower tube temperature to 110°C (feature_list["adjust_lower_tube_temperature"]).
#    User manual: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking."
# 4. Set the cooking time to 40 minutes (feature_list["adjust_time_or_stay_on"]).
#    User manual: "Adjust cooking time. Turn the time knob to set the desired time."

# Using the given Correct Feature:
# Feature Names to Achieve the Command:
# - feature_list["adjust_upper_tube_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_function_selection"]
# - feature_list["adjust_lower_tube_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_time_or_stay_on"]

# Final Variable States to Achieve the Command:
# - variable_upper_tube_temperature = 230
# - variable_function_selection = "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# - variable_lower_tube_temperature = 110
# - variable_time_adjustment = 40
