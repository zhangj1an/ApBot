# The given code accurately models the relevant appliance features needed to achieve the command.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "adjust_upper_element_temperature" to set the upper element temperature to 450°F.
# 2. Use "adjust_function_dial" to set the function to Toast/Broil.
# 3. Use "adjust_lower_element_temperature" to set the lower element temperature to 450°F.
