# Here is the analysis and recommendations before proceeding with the code implementation:
# The command is: "Turn on the microwave to roast vegetables. Set the upper heater temperature to 230 °C, the lower heater temperature to 230 °C, the timer to 40 minutes, and use the lower & upper heater function."
# Referring to the provided user manual and code:
# - The current "Simulator" class and its feature list seem accurate and sufficient to follow the user command.
# - The features needed to achieve this command are:
#   1. adjust_upper_heater_temperature: Adjust the upper heater temperature to 230°C.
#   2. adjust_lower_heater_temperature: Adjust the lower heater temperature to 230°C.
#   3. adjust_timer: Set the timer to 40 minutes.
#   4. select_function: Select the "Lower & Upper Heater" function using the function knob.
# - All variables required are already defined: `variable_upper_heater_temperature`, `variable_lower_heater_temperature`, `variable_timer`, `variable_function_knob`.
# - The actions included in the existing features allow seamless adjustment of these variables.

# As per these observations, there are no missing appliances or features explicitly mentioned in the user manual. No changes or extensions are required to the existing code.

# Sequence of features to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "adjust_upper_heater_temperature" to set `variable_upper_heater_temperature` to 230°C.
# 2. Use "adjust_lower_heater_temperature" to set `variable_lower_heater_temperature` to 230°C.
# 3. Use "adjust_timer" to set `variable_timer` to 40 minutes.
# 4. Use "select_function" to set `variable_function_knob` to "Lower & Upper Heater".

# Raw user manual text that supports this approach:
# - "Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs: Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C"
# - "Timer: The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches '0'."
# - "Function knob:
#   □ Operates the lower heater
#   □ Operates the upper heater
#   □ Operates the lower & upper heater at the same time
#   ⌛ Convection (Lower & upper heater heating)
#   ↻ Rotary (Upper heater heating) Fermentation."

# The corresponding feature list names in the given code are:
# - feature_list["adjust_upper_heater_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_lower_heater_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_timer"]
# - feature_list["select_function"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - Set `variable_upper_heater_temperature` to 230 °C.
# - Set `variable_lower_heater_temperature` to 230 °C.
# - Set `variable_timer` to "40".
# - Set `variable_function_knob` to "Lower & Upper Heater".

# ExtendedSimulator is implemented below but does not require changes to existing Simulator features.
