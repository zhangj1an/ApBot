Feedback Variable: 

 variable_temperature_dial: 100°c 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the goal state and the feedback.

Goal state:  
variable_temperature_dial = "100°C"  

Feedback:  
variable_temperature_dial = "100°c"  

### Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Compare the values**: The goal state requires "100°C", and the feedback shows "100°c".  
   - The difference between the two values is only in capitalization ("C" vs "c").  
   - According to Rule 2, differences in capitalization or textual formatting should be considered semantically the same.  

2. **Check for better matches**:  
   - There is no better match for "100°C" in the variable range, as "100°c" matches the goal exactly except for capitalization.  

### Conclusion:  
The feedback value matches the goal value based on the comparison rules.
