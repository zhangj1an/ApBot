# The provided code is missing the variable and feature necessary to model turning the appliance on and off. 
# Quoting the relevant user manual information:
# "Timer Dial must always be set to a desired time to begin heating."
# This implies that heating starts upon setting the timer and the upper and lower element temperatures. 
# However, turning on the appliance or any explicit mention of how it starts is not modeled in the code. 

# Additionally, the user manual does not describe any explicit action or button to turn the appliance on or off, suggesting it may start automatically when the timer is set and the modes are selected. 

# The current code models the features as follows:
# - Feature 1: "adjust_upper_element_temperature" allows setting the upper element temperature
# - Feature 2: "adjust_lower_element_temperature" allows setting the lower element temperature
# - Feature 3: "adjust_function_dial" allows setting the function/mode
# - Feature 4: "adjust_timer_dial" allows setting the timer
# These features comprehensively allow the necessary adjustments specified in the user manual.

# Therefore, to achieve the requested task, follow this sequence of features and variable adjustments:
# - Feature name: "adjust_upper_element_temperature" - Set variable_upper_element_temperature to "350".
# - Feature name: "adjust_lower_element_temperature" - Set variable_lower_element_temperature to "350".
# - Feature name: "adjust_function_dial" - Set variable_function_dial to "Toast/Broil" (Bake falls under this category based on the user manual).
# - Feature name: "adjust_timer_dial" - Set variable_timer to "40".

# Goal variable values for the command:
# variable_upper_element_temperature = "350"
# variable_lower_element_temperature = "350"
# variable_function_dial = "Toast/Broil"
# variable_timer = "40"
