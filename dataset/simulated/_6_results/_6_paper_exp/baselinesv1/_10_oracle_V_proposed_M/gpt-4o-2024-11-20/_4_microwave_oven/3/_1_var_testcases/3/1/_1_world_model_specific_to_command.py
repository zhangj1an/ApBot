# The current code correctly models the appliance features required to fulfill the user command. 
# Below is the justification:

# Sequence of features needed for the user command:
# 1. Adjust the upper tube temperature to 150°C: This corresponds to the feature "adjust_upper_tube_temperature".
#    - User manual text: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    - Feature list name: "adjust_upper_tube_temperature"
# 2. Select the cooking function as upper and lower heating tube: This corresponds to the feature "adjust_function_selection".
#    - User manual text: "Select cooking function. The upper and lower heating tubes heat up at the same time, and the food is evenly heated to achieve a perfect roasting effect."
#    - Feature list name: "adjust_function_selection"
# 3. Adjust the lower tube temperature to 190°C: This corresponds to the feature "adjust_lower_tube_temperature".
#    - User manual text: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    - Feature list name: "adjust_lower_tube_temperature"
# 4. Adjust the cooking time to 30 minutes: This corresponds to the feature "adjust_time_or_stay_on".
#    - User manual text: "Adjust cooking time. If the cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, then turn the time knob back to the desired time position."
#    - Feature list name: "adjust_time_or_stay_on"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_upper_tube_temperature: 150
# variable_function_selection: "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# variable_lower_tube_temperature: 190
# variable_time_adjustment: 30
# variable_start_running: "off" (not explicitly required to be "on" since the user command does not request a "Stay On" state)
