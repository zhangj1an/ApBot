# The current code already accurately represents the features and actions necessary for the input user command: "Time defrost for 5 minutes with 30% power, then start the appliance."

# Sequence of features to achieve the command:
# 1. "set_time_defrost" to set the defrost time to 5 minutes.
# 2. "set_time_defrost" again to set the power level to 30%.
# 3. "set_time_defrost" to start the appliance.

# Relevant user manual text:
# **7. TIME DEFROST FUNCTION**

# 4. Press "START/+30SEC." to start defrosting. The remained cooking time will be displayed.

# Feature in the given code: "set_time_defrost"

# Goal variable values:
# 1. `variable_time_defrost` set to "00:05:00".
