# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance variables and features needed to accomplish the user command. 
# Specifically:
# 1. The "adjust_upper_element_temperature" feature models the ability to adjust the upper element temperature.
# 2. The "adjust_lower_element_temperature" feature models the ability to adjust the lower element temperature.
# 3. The "adjust_function_dial" feature models selecting a function such as "Toast/Broil", "Convection", etc.
# 4. The "adjust_timer_dial" feature models setting the timer by turning the timer dial. 

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Use the "adjust_upper_element_temperature" feature to set the upper element temperature to 350°F.
# 2. Use the "adjust_function_dial" feature to set the function to "Bake".
# 3. Use the "adjust_lower_element_temperature" feature to set the lower element temperature to 450°F.
# 4. Use the "adjust_timer_dial" feature to set the timer to 30 minutes.

# Relevant raw user manual text:
# 1. "**Temperature Dial for Upper Elements Only** – Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake, Broil, Toast or Rotisserie."
# 2. "**Function Dial** – Use this dial to set Convection, Rotisserie or Convection Rotisserie. This knob does not need to be set for Bake, Broil, Keep Warm, or Toast."
# 3. "**Temperature Dial for Lower Elements Only** – Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake or Toast."
# 4. "**Timer Dial** – This dial must be set to a desired time to begin heating."

# Relevant feature_list entries from the provided code:
# - feature_list["adjust_upper_element_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_lower_element_temperature"]
# - feature_list["adjust_function_dial"]
# - feature_list["adjust_timer_dial"]

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_upper_element_temperature to "350".
# - Set variable_function_dial to "Bake". (Assuming "Bake" corresponds to "Toast/Broil" in the code, this target is valid.)
# - Set variable_lower_element_temperature to "450".
# - Set variable_timer to 30.
