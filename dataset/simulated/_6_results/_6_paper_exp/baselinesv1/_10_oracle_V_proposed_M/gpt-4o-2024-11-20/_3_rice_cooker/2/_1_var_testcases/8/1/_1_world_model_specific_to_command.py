# After evaluating the user manual along with the provided model code, it appears that the given code is incomplete in addressing the described user command functionalities. Specifically:
# 
# 1. **Cooking Mode Adjustment**:
#    The code has `variable_cooking_mode` and the corresponding feature `set_cooking_mode`, which allows cycling between the cooking modes using the button `press_menu_cancel_button`. This is correctly modeled and functional for selecting "soup" mode.
#
# 2. **Preset Timer**:
#    The code includes `variable_preset_timer` and the corresponding feature `set_preset_timer`, allowing the adjustment of the preset timer. This feature component is modeled correctly. However, the current code uses `press_preset_time_time_button` without a mechanism to increment or control timer changes incrementally across its range. We need to ensure this functionality is adjustable correctly.
#
# 3. **Start Cooking**:
#    The appliance feature `start_running` exists to toggle between ON/OFF states using the `press_start_button`. This is correctly modeled and sets the variable to "on" as specified.
#
# Overall, for the user command (set mode "soup", set timer 6 hours, and start machine), the code has covered most aspects. Only minor refinements or additions are needed for clarity.

# The feature sequence to achieve the user command is:
# 1) Adjust the cooking mode to "soup" (linked to the feature `set_cooking_mode` and `variable_cooking_mode`).
# 2) Set the preset timer to "6 hours" (linked to the feature `set_preset_timer` and `variable_preset_timer`).
# 3) Start the appliance (linked to the feature `start_running` and `variable_start_running`).

# Features to achieve the command:
# 1. **Feature: `set_cooking_mode`** - "Press `menu/cancel` button to select the cooking mode."
#    User Manual Reference: "`Press Menu/Cancel to choose Fast cook, White rice, Congee, Soup, Cake, or Keep warm.`"
#
# 2. **Feature: `set_preset_timer`** - "Press `Preset/Timer` to adjust the timer for delayed cooking."
#    User Manual Reference: "`Press Preset/Timer to adjust the time. With each press, the time increases by 15 minutes... The preset time is up to 24 hours.`"
#
# 3. **Feature: `start_running`** - "Press `Start` button to start the cooking process."
#    User Manual Reference: "`Press Start to start the cooking process.`"

# Below is the detailed ExtendedSimulator class with feature handling for the user command.
