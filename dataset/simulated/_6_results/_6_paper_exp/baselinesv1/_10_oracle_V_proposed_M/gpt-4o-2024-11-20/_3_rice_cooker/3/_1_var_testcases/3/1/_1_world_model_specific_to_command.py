# Python comment:
# The current code is accurate and correctly models the appliance features as described in the user manual.
# To achieve the user command "Adjust the delay time to 1 hour, choose Quinoa, and start running," we can use the given features:
# - Feature "set_delay_timer" to adjust the delay time to 1 hour (variable_delay_timer).
# - Feature "set_menu" to select the Quinoa menu (variable_menu_index) and adjust its settings if necessary (variable_menu_setting).
# - Feature "start_cooking" to set the appliance to start running (variable_start_running).
# 
# Relevant raw user manual text for each feature:
# 1. Set delay time:
#    "Press Delay Timer to delay the start of your cooker cycle. The unit will only start to cook after the countdown is complete. Use + and - to increase or decrease the desired start time..."
# 2. Select menu:
#    "Press menu button to scroll through preset functions, White Rice, Brown Rice, Quinoa, Steel Cut Oats. Indicator light shows which function is selected..."
# 3. Start cooking:
#    "Press the Start button to begin cooking."

# Features in the given code:
# - Feature "set_delay_timer" corresponds to the first step.
# - Feature "set_menu" corresponds to the second step.
# - Feature "start_cooking" corresponds to the third step.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_delay_timer to 1.
# - Set variable_menu_index to "Quinoa".
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
