#    - User manual: "Press Menu/Cancel to choose Fast cook (symbol for fast cook), White rice (symbol for white rice)."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_cooking_mode"]
#
# 2. Adjust the preset timer to 8 hours using the "set_preset_timer" feature.
#    - User manual: "The preset time is up to 24 hours. If you want to enjoy delicious rice after 8 hours, set the preset time to 8 hours."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_preset_timer"]
#
# 3. Start the machine by using the "start_running" feature.
#    - User manual: "Press Start to start the cooking process."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["start_running"]

# Note: The provided code already includes the correct variables and features to handle the request:
# - To set the cooking mode, variable_cooking_mode and feature_list["set_cooking_mode"] are used.
# - To adjust the preset timer, variable_preset_timer and feature_list["set_preset_timer"] are used.
# - To start the machine, variable_start_running and feature_list["start_running"] are used.

# Below are the goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_cooking_mode: "congee"
# - variable_preset_timer: 480 (minutes, which corresponds to 8 hours)
