# Here are my observations regarding the user's request:
# The request is to "Set to cook bean for 1 hour and 10 minutes, then start".
# Based on the user manual, the procedure involves setting the menu program to "Bean", configuring the cooking time, and starting the appliance.
# Let’s verify if the provided code already models these steps or if any adjustment or addition is required.

# Observations:
# 1. **Set Menu to "Bean"**:
#    The code includes `feature_list["select_menu_option"]`, allowing the menu to be set to "Bean". This step is implemented as using `press_menu_button`.
#    -> This part of the feature is correctly modeled.
#
# 2. **Set Cooking Time**:
#    The feature `feature_list["set_cooking_time"]` allows for adjusting the cooking time via `press_hr_button` and `press_min_button` actions. The cooking time can be set per the user’s requirements using `variable_cooking_time_hours` and `variable_cooking_time_minutes`.
#    -> This part of the feature is correctly modeled.
#
# 3. **Start Cooking**:
#    The feature `feature_list["start_cooking"]` models starting the appliance using `press_start_button`, which sets `variable_start_cooking` to "on".
#    -> This part of the feature is correctly modeled.

# Steps required to achieve the user's command using the provided code:
# - Step 1: Select the "Bean" menu (`feature_list["select_menu_option"]`).
# - Step 2: Set the cooking time to 1 hour and 10 minutes (`feature_list["set_cooking_time"]`).
# - Step 3: Start cooking (`feature_list["start_cooking"]`).

# Relevant user manual text confirming the process:
# - "Press the 'Menu' button to select the desired function (Bean)."
# - "Press the 'Cooking time' button. Use the 'Hr.' and 'Min.' buttons to set the cooking time."
# - "Press the 'Start' button to begin cooking."
#
# Features in the provided code that are relevant:
# - Feature: `select_menu_option`
# - Feature: `set_cooking_time`
# - Feature: `start_cooking`

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - `variable_menu_index` = "Bean"
# - `variable_cooking_time_hours` = 1
# - `variable_cooking_time_minutes` = 10
# - `variable_start_cooking` = "on"

# Since the provided code already models these features correctly, no changes are required.
