# Python comment:

# The sequence of features required to achieve the command based on the current system:
# 1. Use "select_cooking_program" feature to set the cooker to the "white_rice" program by pressing the corresponding button.
# 2. Use "adjust_preset_time" feature to adjust the preset time to 8 hours (480 minutes) using the "press_preset_button".
# 3. Use the "start_running" feature to start the machine by pressing the "press_start_button".

# The user manual explicitly mentions selecting cooking programs, adjusting the preset finish time, and starting the machine:
# - "Select the program you want to choose directly, and the light of the selected program will be on."
# - "When the cooking program is chosen ... press the `Preset` button to set the time for finishing cooking."
# - "Press `Start` button to start cooking when ready."
# These align with the existing feature_list and their corresponding variable settings.

# Existing feature_list names in the generated code:
# - "select_cooking_program"
# - "adjust_preset_time"
# - "start_running"

# The goal variable states to achieve this command:
# - "variable_cooking_program" = "white_rice"
# - "variable_preset_time" = 480
# - "variable_start_running" = "on"
