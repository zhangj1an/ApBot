# Step 2: Using the "set_cooking_time" feature, we can adjust the cooking time to 30 minutes.
# Relevant user manual text: 
# "Adjust cooking time by pressing 'Cooking time' button and use 'Hr.' and 'Min.' buttons for time regulation."
# Feature_list name in given code: feature_list["set_cooking_time"]
