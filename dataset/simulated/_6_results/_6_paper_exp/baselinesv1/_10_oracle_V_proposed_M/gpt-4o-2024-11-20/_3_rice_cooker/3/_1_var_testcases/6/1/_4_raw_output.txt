Feedback Variable: 

 variable_menu_selection: steel cut oats 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the given feedback and the goal state:

**Goal State Requirement:**
We want the variable `variable_menu_setting` to have a value of `25`.

**Feedback Provided:**
`variable_menu_selection: steel cut oats`

---

### Step 1: Compare the values
The goal state requires `variable_menu_setting` to have a value of `25`. The feedback, however, provides information about `variable_menu_selection`, which is `"steel cut oats"`. The two variables are not directly comparable because they represent different aspects of the system.

---

### Step 2: Apply the comparison rules
1. **Rule 1:** The variable names already represent different items (`variable_menu_setting` vs. `variable_menu_selection`), so they are not directly comparable.
2. **Rule 5:** The goal is to set `variable_menu_setting` to `25`. The feedback does not provide any numerical value or information about this specific variable, so it does not confirm that the goal has been reached.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion
The feedback does not match the goal state for `variable_menu_setting`. Therefore:

reason = "The feedback provides information about 'variable_menu_selection' being 'steel cut oats', but the goal state requires 'variable_menu_setting' to have a value of 25. These are different variables, and the feedback does not confirm the goal state for 'variable_menu_setting'."
goal_reached = False 


Execution failed on attempt 1: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 reason = "The goal state requires the variable 'variable_menu_setting' to have a value of 25, which corresponds to the 'Steel Cut Oats' menu setting. The feedback provided is 'variable_menu_selection: steel cut oats', which confirms that the 'Steel Cut Oats' menu has been selected. However, the feedback does not provide any information about the specific menu setting value (25). Since the feedback does not confirm the exact target value of 25 for the variable 'variable_menu_setting', the goal has not been reached."

goal_reached = False

Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is press_plus_button. The first observed action is press_plus_button.
Analysis results: The variable variable_menu_setting_quinoa is ContinuousVariable with value ranges and step values to be [[20, 40, 1]]. The current value is 30.

Attempt to update goal: round 1

Your previous attempt to modify variable_menu_setting has the following result: 
goal_state.variable_menu_setting = goal_state.menu_setting_dict["Quinoa"]
goal_state.variable_menu_setting.set_value_ranges_steps([[20, 40, 1]])
goal_state.variable_menu_setting.set_current_value(35) # each number represents minutes.
This results in an error: set_value_ranges_steps() missing 1 required positional argument: 'current_value'. Please correct the error and try again.
