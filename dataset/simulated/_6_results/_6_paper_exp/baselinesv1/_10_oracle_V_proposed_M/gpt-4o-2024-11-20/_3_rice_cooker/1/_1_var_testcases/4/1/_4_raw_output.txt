Feedback Variable: 

 variable_cooking_time_minute: 40 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the goal state and the feedback:

**Goal State**:  
`variable_cooking_time_minutes` = 10  

**Feedback**:  
`variable_cooking_time_minute` = 40  

### Step-by-Step Comparison:

1. **Variable Name**:  
   The variable names `variable_cooking_time_minutes` and `variable_cooking_time_minute` are already verified to represent the same item. Therefore, we only need to compare their values.

2. **Value Comparison**:  
   - The goal state requires the value to be 10.  
   - The feedback shows the value is 40.  
   - Both values represent time in minutes, so we directly compare them. Since 10 ≠ 40, the feedback does not match the goal value.

3. **No Better Option**:  
   The feedback value of 40 does not match the goal value of 10, and there is no indication that 40 is a better option than 10 for this variable.

### Conclusion:

reason = "The goal state requires the variable 'variable_cooking_time_minutes' to have a value of 10, but the feedback shows a value of 40. Since these values do not match, the goal has not been reached."  
goal_reached = False

Comparison result:

Feedback Variable: 

 {'feature': ('start', 1)} 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the goal state and the feedback.

**Goal State:**
The goal is to have the variable `variable_start_cooking` set to `"on"`.

**Feedback:**
The feedback provided is: `{'feature': ('start', 1)}`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Compare Variable Names:**
   - The variable names are verified to represent the same item. Therefore, we focus on comparing the values.

2. **Compare Values:**
   - The goal state value is `"on"`.
   - The feedback value is `('start', 1)`. This indicates the "start" feature is active.
   - Based on Rule 6: If the combination of variable name and value means the same thing, we should return `True`. Here, the feedback `('start', 1)` semantically means that the cooking process has started, which aligns with the goal state of `variable_start_cooking = "on"`.

### Conclusion:

reason = "The feedback value `('start', 1)` semantically means the cooking process has started, which aligns with the goal state of `variable_start_cooking = 'on'`."
goal_reached = True 


Execution failed on attempt 1: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 To evaluate the feedback against the goal state, let us analyze:

- The goal state requires `variable_start_cooking` to have a value of `"on"`.
- The feedback provided is `{'feature': ('start', 1)}`.

### Step-by-step Comparison:
1. **Goal Value vs Feedback Value:**
   - The goal value is `"on"`.
   - The feedback value is `('start', 1)`.

2. **Semantic Matching:**
   - The feedback value `('start', 1)` indicates that the feature is in the "start" state, which semantically matches the goal value `"on"`. Both indicate that the cooking process has been initiated or started.

3. **Rules Applied:**
   - **Rule 6:** The combination of variable name and value in the feedback (`'feature': ('start', 1)`) means the same thing as the goal state (`variable_start_cooking = "on"`). Both indicate the cooking process is active or has started.

### Conclusion:
reason = "The feedback value `('start', 1)` semantically matches the goal value `'on'`, as both indicate the cooking process is active. Rule 6 confirms that these states are equivalent."
goal_reached = True 


Execution failed on attempt 2: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 To determine if the goal state matches the feedback, let's evaluate the provided feedback against the goal state.

### Goal State:
The goal is to have `variable_start_cooking` with a value of `"on"`.

### Feedback:
The feedback is `{'feature': ('start', 1)}`.

### Evaluation:

1. **Variable Name Matching**: The variable names are already verified to represent the same item. So, we only need to compare the values.

2. **Feedback Value Interpretation**: The feedback value is `('start', 1)`. This indicates the feature is "start" and the value is `1`. The goal state value is `"on"`.

3. **Semantic Comparison**:
   - The feedback value `('start', 1)` semantically aligns with the goal state value `"on"`. 
   - The feature name "start" matches the idea of initiating or turning something "on."
   - The numerical value `1` is often used to represent "on" in binary or boolean systems.

4. **Conclusion**: Based on the above, the feedback value is semantically equivalent to the goal state value `"on"`.

### Final Decision:

reason = "The feedback value `('start', 1)` semantically matches the goal state value `'on'` because 'start' aligns with turning 'on,' and `1` is commonly used to represent 'on' in binary systems."

Feedback Variable: 

 {'feature': ('start', 1)} 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the feedback and compare it with the goal state.

### Goal State:
We want `variable_start_cooking` to have a value of `"on"`.

### Feedback:
The feedback is `{'feature': ('start', 1)}`.

### Analysis:
1. The goal value is `"on"`, and the feedback value is `('start', 1)`.
2. Comparing the feedback value, `('start', 1)`:
   - The word `"start"` in the feedback aligns semantically with `"on"` in the goal state, as both indicate the action of starting or turning on the cooking process.
   - The number `1` in the feedback can be interpreted as "on" or "active," which also aligns semantically with the goal value `"on"`.
3. Based on Rule 6, if the combination of variable name and variable value means the same thing, we should consider them equivalent. Here, the feedback indicates the cooking process has started, which matches the goal state of having `variable_start_cooking` set to `"on"`.

### Conclusion:
reason = "The feedback value `('start', 1)` semantically indicates that the cooking process has started, which matches the goal state of `variable_start_cooking` being set to 'on'."
