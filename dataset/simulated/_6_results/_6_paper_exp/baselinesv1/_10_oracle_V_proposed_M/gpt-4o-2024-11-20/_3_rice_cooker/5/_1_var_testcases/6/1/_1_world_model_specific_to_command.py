# Based on the user command, let's validate the current code against the user manual.

# **Relevant Features from the User Manual:**
# - "**Preset**: When the cooking program is chosen (not available on 'Clay Pot', Reheat and 'Keep Warm'), press the 'Preset' button to set the time for finishing cooking. Press 'Start' button when the time is set. The 'Preset' indicator will be on."
# - "**Start**: The appliance starts cooking after pressing the 'Start' button."

# **Sequence of Features Needed to Achieve Command:**
# 1. Choose cooking program to "jasmine_rice." (using feature_list["select_cooking_program"])
# 2. Set the preset time by pressing the preset button. (using feature_list["adjust_preset_time"])
# 3. Start the machine by pressing the start button. (using feature_list["start_running"])

# The current code already models the necessary variables:
# 1. `variable_cooking_program` for the cooking program set to "jasmine_rice."
# 2. `variable_preset_time` for setting the preset to 7 hours (420 minutes).
# 3. `variable_start_running` for starting the machine.

# **Ensuring Accuracy of Features:**
# - The current `feature_list` already captures the required actions for these features:
#   - "select_cooking_program."
#   - "adjust_preset_time."
#   - "start_running."

# **Goal Variable Values to Achieve the User Command:**
# - `variable_cooking_program`: "jasmine_rice."
# - `variable_preset_time`: 420 (7 hours in minutes).
# - `variable_start_running`: "on."
