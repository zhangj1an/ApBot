# The current code is accurate for executing the user command:
# "Set the mode to soup, set timer to 3 hours, and start the machine."
# Here is the plan to achieve the command step-by-step:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Set the cooking mode to soup (feature: "set_cooking_mode").
# 2. Set the preset timer to 3 hours (feature: "set_preset_timer").
# 3. Start the machine (feature: "start_running").

# Relevant user manual text:
# - To select cooking mode: 
#   "Press Menu/Cancel to select Congee (bowl symbol) or Soup (steam symbol)."
# - To set the preset timer:
#   "Press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer. With each press, the time increases by 15 minutes."
# - To start the machine:
#   "Press Start to start the cooking process."

# Corresponding feature_list names in the code:
# - "set_cooking_mode"
# - "set_preset_timer"
# - "start_running"

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - Set variable_cooking_mode to "soup".
# - Set variable_preset_timer to 180 (3 hours = 180 minutes).
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
