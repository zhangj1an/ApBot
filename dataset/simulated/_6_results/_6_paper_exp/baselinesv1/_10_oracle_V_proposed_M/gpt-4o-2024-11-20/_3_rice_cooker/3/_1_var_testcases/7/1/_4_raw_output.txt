Feedback Variable: 

 variable_menu_selection: white rice 


Comparison result: 

 Let's compare the goal state and the given feedback:

**Goal State:**  
We want to have the variable: `variable_menu_setting` to have a value of 40.

**Feedback:**  
`variable_menu_selection: white rice`

---

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Variable Name Comparison**:  
   The variable names `variable_menu_setting` (goal) and `variable_menu_selection` (feedback) represent related but different items. `variable_menu_setting` refers to the cooking time (40 minutes in this case), while `variable_menu_selection` refers to the menu or program selected (e.g., "White Rice").  

   Since the variable names are not the same, they do not directly represent the same item. However, we can analyze further to see if the feedback indirectly supports the goal.

2. **Value Comparison**:  
   - The goal value for `variable_menu_setting` is **40** (minutes).  
   - The feedback value is **white rice**, which corresponds to the menu selection and not the cooking time.  

   The feedback does not provide any information about the cooking time (40 minutes), which is the goal. Thus, the feedback does not confirm the goal state.

3. **Semantic Match**:  
   While "White Rice" is indirectly related to the goal (as "White Rice" is the selected menu), the feedback does not confirm that the cooking time is set to 40 minutes, which is the specific goal for `variable_menu_setting`.

4. **Comparison Rules**:  
   Rule 5 applies here: If in the variable range, there is an option that matches the goal value better than the feedback value, return "False." The feedback does not confirm that the cooking time is set to 40 minutes, so the goal is not achieved.

---

### Conclusion:  
The feedback does not confirm that the variable `variable_menu_setting` has a value of 40.  

**Reason**: "The feedback 'variable_menu_selection: white rice' only confirms the menu selection but does not confirm the cooking time (40 minutes) for `variable_menu_setting`. Thus, the goal has not been reached."  
**Goal Reached**: False 


Execution failed on attempt 1: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 reason = "The goal state requires the variable 'variable_menu_setting' to have a value of 40, which represents the cooking time for 'White Rice'. The feedback provided is 'variable_menu_selection: white rice'. Rule 6 applies here, as the feedback indicates that the menu is set to 'White Rice', which matches the goal state. However, the feedback does not explicitly confirm that the cooking time is set to 40 minutes, which is part of the goal. Therefore, the goal has not been fully reached yet."

goal_reached = False
