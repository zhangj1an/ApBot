# The current code has accurately implemented the relevant features to achieve the desired user command,
# which is to switch on the dehumidifier and set the timer for 2 hours.

# To achieve the command, the sequence of features needed is:
# 1. Feature: "power_control" - Turn the unit on.
#    - User manual: "Turns the unit on and off."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["power_control"]
# 2. Feature: "adjust_timer" - Set the timer to 2 hours.
#    - User manual: "Sets an Auto-On or Shut-Off timer, 1H, 2H or 4H."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["adjust_timer"]

# The goal variable values to achieve the command are:
# 1. Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# 2. Set variable_timer to "2".
