# The current code has already accurately modeled the relevant appliance features to achieve the given user command. Here's why:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Adjust the cycle selector to "Cotton."
#    - User manual: "Cycle Selector: Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
#    - Feature list reference: "adjust_cycle_selector."
#
# 2. Adjust the temperature to "30 °C."
#    - User manual: "Temp button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 95 °C."
#    - Feature list reference: "adjust_temperature."
#
# 3. Adjust the spin speed to "800 rpm."
#    - User manual: "Spin button: Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    - Feature list reference: "adjust_spin_speed."
#
# 4. Adjust the option to "Prewash."
#    - User manual: "Option button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak, Intensive, Prewash, Rinse+, Soak + Rinse+, Intensive + Rinse+, Prewash + Rinse+, Off."
#    - Feature list reference: "adjust_options."
#
# 5. Set the delay end to 5 hours.
#    - User manual: "Delay End: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
#    - Feature list reference: "adjust_delay_end."
#
# 6. Start the machine.
#    - User manual: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."
#    - Feature list reference: "start_pause_cycle."

# The sequence of features needed is fully accounted in the given Simulator code, and no additional modifications are required.

# Generate the goal variable values to achieve the user command:
class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator): 
    pass

goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_power_on_off": "on",              # Ensure the power is on
    "variable_cycle_selector": "Cotton",       # Use the cotton cycle
    "variable_temperature": "30°C",            # Set temperature to 30°C
    "variable_spin_speed": "800",              # Set spin speed to 800 rpm
    "variable_option": "Prewash",              # Use Prewash option
    "variable_delay_end": 5,                   # Set delay end to 5 hours
    "variable_start_running": "on"             # Start the machine
