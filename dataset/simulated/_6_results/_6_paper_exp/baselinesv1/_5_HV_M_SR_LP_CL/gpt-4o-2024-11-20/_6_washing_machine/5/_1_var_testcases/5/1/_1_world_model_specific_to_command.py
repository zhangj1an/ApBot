# The given code for the washing machine already accounts for the necessary variables and features described in the user manual to achieve the requested user command. 

# Relevant user manual text:
# 1. "1 On/Off button: Product is switched On or Off." (Feature: "on_off").
# 2. "Program buttons: Available according to the laundry type." (Feature: "set_program").
# 3. "Water Level: Select water level according to clothing categories..." (Feature: "set_water_level").
# 4. "Function: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable." (Features: "set_time_manager", "set_rinse_times", "set_spin_speed").
#  
# Steps to achieve the user command:
# - Turn on the washing appliance: Use feature "on_off".
# - Choose 'Heavy Duty': Use feature "set_program".
# - Mid water level: Use feature "set_water_level".
# - Adjust 50 minutes on time manager: Use feature "set_time_manager".
# - Rinse '1 Time': Use feature "set_rinse_times".
# - Spin 'Regular': Use feature "set_spin_speed".

# Feature sequence required:
# 1. "on_off" to turn on the appliance.
# 2. "set_program" to set the program to 'Heavy Duty'.
# 3. "set_water_level" to set water level to 'Mid' (interpreted as "3").
# 4. "set_time_manager" to adjust the time to 50 minutes (nearest possible step, handled by value options).
# 5. "set_rinse_times" to set rinse times to '1 Time'.
# 6. "set_spin_speed" to set spin to 'Regular'.

# Goal variables to achieve the user command:
# - Set variable_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_program to "Heavy Duty".
# - Set variable_water_level to "3".
# - Set variable_time_manager to "50 minutes" if accurately adjustable, otherwise closest possible representation.
