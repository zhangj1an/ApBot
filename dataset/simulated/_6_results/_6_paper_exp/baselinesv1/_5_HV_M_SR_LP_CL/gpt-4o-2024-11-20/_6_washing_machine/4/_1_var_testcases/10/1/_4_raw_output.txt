Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the given feedback and the goal state:

Goal: `variable_washing_time` becomes 12.  
Feedback: `variable_wash_time`: 6.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable Naming**: The variable names `variable_washing_time` (goal) and `variable_wash_time` (feedback) represent the same item (washing time). So, we proceed to compare their values.

2. **Value Comparison**:  
   - The goal requires `variable_washing_time` to be 12, while the feedback shows `variable_wash_time` as 6.  
   - Both values are numbers and represent time in minutes. Since 12 (goal) is not equal to 6 (feedback), the feedback does not match the goal.

3. **Options in Variable Range**: There is no indication that 6 is the best achievable value for washing time compared to the goal of 12. Therefore, the goal has not been reached.

### Conclusion:
reason = "The goal requires the washing time to be 12 minutes, but the feedback shows it as 6 minutes. Since these values are not equal and there is no evidence that 6 is the closest achievable value to 12, the goal has not been reached."
