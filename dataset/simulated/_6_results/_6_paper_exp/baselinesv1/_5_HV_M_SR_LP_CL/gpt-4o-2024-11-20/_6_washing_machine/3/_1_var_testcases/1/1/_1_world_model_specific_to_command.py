# The given code mostly accurately models the appliance based on the user manual description. For the user command:
# "Turn on the washing machine, select the Normal program for everyday clothes, set the water level to 55 L, set the preset to finish in 4 hours, start the appliance, then activate the child lock."
# Here is the verification:

# Step-by-step verification:
# 1) Turn on the washing machine:
#    - The feature "toggle_power" is correctly defined with variable "variable_power_on_off". It allows toggling power on/off.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press 'Start/Pause' within 10 minutes after power-on."

# 2) Select the Normal program:
#    - The feature "select_program" is correctly defined with variable "variable_program_selection". It allows selecting the Normal program.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "Everyday clothes: 1 Normal."

# 3) Set the water level to 55 L:
#    - The feature "adjust_water_level" is correctly defined with variable "variable_water_level". It allows selecting the water level.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "Change Water Level - During the wash process, press 'Water Level' to change the water level."

# 4) Set the preset to finish in 4 hours:
#    - The feature "adjust_preset_timer" is correctly defined with variable "variable_preset_timer". It allows setting the timer.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours)."

# 5) Start the appliance:
#    - The feature "start_operation" is defined with variable "variable_start_running". It sets the appliance to start running.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "3. Start. - Press Start/Pause."

# 6) Activate the child lock:
#    - The feature "set_child_lock" is defined with variable "variable_child_lock". It activates the child lock.
#    - Raw text from the user manual: "Setting Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, if the lid is opened while the washing machine is operating, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed."

# Based on this analysis, the existing code already models all the necessary features accurately. The commands can be executed in sequence using the given features and actions. Here are the required steps and the goal variable values:

# Sequence of features:
# 1) Use "toggle_power" to turn the power on.
# 2) Use "select_program" to select the "1 Normal" program.
# 3) Use "adjust_water_level" to set the water level to "55 L".
# 4) Use "adjust_preset_timer" to set the preset timer to "4 hours".
# 5) Use "start_operation" to start the appliance.
# 6) Use "set_child_lock" to activate the child lock.

# Goal variable values:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_program_selection to "1 Normal".
# - Set variable_water_level to "55 L".
# - Set variable_preset_timer to 4 (hours).
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
# - Set variable_child_lock to "on".
