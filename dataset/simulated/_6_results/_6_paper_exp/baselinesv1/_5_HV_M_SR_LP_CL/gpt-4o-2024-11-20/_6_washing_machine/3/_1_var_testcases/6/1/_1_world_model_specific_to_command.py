# The current code already models the requested user command. 
# Here is the analysis:

# 1. Activating the washing machine:
#    Raw user manual text: "Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press 'Start/Pause' within 10 minutes after power-on." 
#    Feature: "toggle_power" toggles the power using "press_power_button" or "press_and_hold_power_button".

# 2. Picking the Soak program:
#    Raw user manual text: "Programs - Use the Program button to select a variety of programs such as Normal, Delicate, Soak, etc." 
#    Feature: "select_program" allows selection of programs using "press_program_button".

# 3. Setting the water level to 20 L:
#    Raw user manual text: "Change Water Level - During the wash process, press 'Water Level' to change the water level."
#    Feature: "adjust_water_level" adjusts water level using "press_water_level_button".

# 4. Setting the preset timer to finish in 8 hours:
#    Raw user manual text: "Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours)."
#    Feature: "adjust_preset_timer" adjusts the timer using "press_preset_button".

# 5. Starting the appliance:
#    Raw user manual text: "Start Operation - Pressing Start/Pause will start the operation."
#    Feature: "start_operation" starts the appliance using "press_start_pause_button".

# 6. Activating the child lock:
#    Raw user manual text: "Setting Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, hold the Program button for 5 seconds to activate the child lock."
#    Feature: "set_child_lock" activates the child lock using "press_and_hold_program_button".

# Therefore, all the above steps are accurately modeled in the provided code, and these features are sufficient to handle the described user command.

# Features needed to achieve the command:
# - "toggle_power"
# - "select_program"
# - "adjust_water_level"
# - "adjust_preset_timer"
# - "start_operation"
# - "set_child_lock"

# Goal Variable Values to Achieve the Command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_program_selection` to "6 Soak".
# - Set `variable_water_level` to "20 L".
# - Set `variable_preset_timer` to 8.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
# - Set `variable_child_lock` to "on".
