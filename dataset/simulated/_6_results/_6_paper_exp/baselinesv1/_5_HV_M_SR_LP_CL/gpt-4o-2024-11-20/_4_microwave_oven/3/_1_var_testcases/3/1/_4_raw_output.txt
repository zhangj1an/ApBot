Attempt 1: Trying to analyse the past debug record.
The effective action is turn_upper_tube_temperature_adjustment_dial_clockwise. The first observed action is turn_upper_tube_temperature_adjustment_dial_clockwise.
Analysis results: The variable variable_upper_tube_temperature is ContinuousVariable with value ranges and step values to be [[0, 70, 70], [70, 230, 40]]. The current value is 150.

Attempt 1: Trying to update variable definition.
Updated Variable code: # The variable variable_upper_tube_temperature is ContinuousVariable with value ranges and step values to be [[0, 70, 70], [70, 230, 40]]. The current value is 150.

# Modify Current Value:
# Based on the analysis, the current value should remain as 150, and there is no need for further adjustment.

# Modify Value Range and Step Value:
# No evidence requiring repeating values or change in the step values is observed. Thus, no modifications are needed to the value ranges.

# Modify Value Order:
# As the variable is a ContinuousVariable, and no evidence indicates the order explicitly differs, this does not apply.

# Revised Variable Definition:
variable_upper_tube_temperature = ContinuousVariable(value_ranges_steps=[(0, 70, 70), (70, 230, 40)], current_value=150)
