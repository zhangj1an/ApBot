# Python comment regarding missing features:
# The given code missed out on a "start/running" feature for the appliance. The user manual describes in step-wise instructions:
# 1. The timer dial must be set for the heating process to begin.
# 2. However, there is no explicit power on/off variable or start action mentioned in the user manual.
# Thus, there is no need to add a separate variable or feature for starting the appliance, as the timer naturally initiates the heating process.

# Python comment regarding relevant features for the user command:
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this user command is:
# 1. Set the upper element temperature to 350°F using "set_upper_element_temperature".
#    Relevant user manual text: "Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake, Broil, Toast or Rotisserie."
#    Feature_list name: "set_upper_element_temperature."
# 2. Set the function dial to Bake using "set_function_dial".
#    Relevant user manual text: "Use this dial to set Convection, Rotisserie or Convection Rotisserie."
#    Feature_list name: "set_function_dial."
# 3. Set the lower element temperature to 450°F using "set_lower_element_temperature".
#    Relevant user manual text: "Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake or Toast."
#    Feature_list name: "set_lower_element_temperature."
# 4. Set the timer to 30 minutes using "set_timer".
#    Relevant user manual text: "This dial must be set to a desired time to begin heating."
#    Feature_list name: "set_timer."

# Note: No new features or variables need to be added or modified in this case as the current code correctly models all relevant aspects of the user manual.
