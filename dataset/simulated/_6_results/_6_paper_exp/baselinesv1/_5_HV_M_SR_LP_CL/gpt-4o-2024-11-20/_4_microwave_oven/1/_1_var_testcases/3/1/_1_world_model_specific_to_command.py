# Python comment:

# The current code already accurately models the relevant appliance feature to achieve the requested command, as described in the user manual. 
# To set the required time cooking and power level, the `microwave_cook` feature is used.
# The process steps are:
# Step 1: Use "microwave_cook" to set the cooking time (5 minutes) using number pads.
# Step 2: Set power to 70% (PL7) within the same feature.
# Step 3: Start cooking using the "press_start_plus_30sec_button" action.
#
# Relevant user manual excerpt:
# "Press 'TIME COOK' once, screen will display '00:00'. Press number keys to input the cooking time... Press 'POWER' once, screen will display 'PL10'. Now you can press number keys to adjust the power level. Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start cooking."

# Corresponding feature_list name: "microwave_cook"
#
# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - `variable_time_cook_time` = "00:05:00" (5 minutes)
# - `variable_power` = "PL7" (70% power)
# - `variable_start_running` = "on"
