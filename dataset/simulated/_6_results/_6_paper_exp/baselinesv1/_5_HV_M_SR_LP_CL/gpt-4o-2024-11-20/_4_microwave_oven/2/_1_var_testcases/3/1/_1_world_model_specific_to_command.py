# Python comments: The existing code does not include a variable or a feature for starting/running the appliance. 
# This is essential as the user manual outlines the requirement of setting a timer to engage heating, but there is no direct mention of a dedicated "start" function in the provided user manual. 
# There is also no mention of power-on/off functionality, so I won't add an unnecessary variable for this. 
# Thus, the requested command can be fully modeled using the existing feature structure. Here's a description of steps from the user manual concerning this user command:

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this user command:
# 1. Adjust "upper element temperature" to 350°F.
# 2. Adjust "function dial" to "Bake."
# 3. Adjust "lower element temperature" to 350°F.
# 4. Set "timer" to 40 minutes.

# Relevant user manual text:
# - "Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake, Broil, Toast or Rotisserie."
# - "Set the function dial to Convection, Rotisserie or Convection Rotisserie. This knob does not need to be set for Bake, Broil, Keep Warm, or Toast."
# - "This dial must be set to a desired time to begin heating."
# - "If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20-minute mark to engage the timer then back to the desired time."

# Relevant feature_list names in the given code:
# - "set_upper_element_temperature"
# - "set_function_dial"
# - "set_lower_element_temperature"
# - "set_timer"

# Goal variable values to achieve this user command:
# variable_upper_element_temperature = "350"
# variable_function_dial = "Bake"
# variable_lower_element_temperature = "350"
# variable_timer = 40
