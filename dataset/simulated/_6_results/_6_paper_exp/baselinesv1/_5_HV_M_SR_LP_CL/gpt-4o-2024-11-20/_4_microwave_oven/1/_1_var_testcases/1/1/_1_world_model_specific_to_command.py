# The given code seems to accurately model the relevant appliance feature needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use the "microwave_cook" feature to set the cooking time to 8 minutes with 90% power.
# 2. Use the "speedy_cooking" feature or start the appliance using "press_start_plus_30sec_button".

# User manual text that supports this:
# From "MICROWAVE COOK":
# 1. Press "TIME COOK" once, screen will display "00:00".
# 2. Press number keys to input the cooking time.
# 3. Press "POWER" once, screen will display "PL10".
# 4. Now you can press number keys to adjust the power level.
# 5. Press "START/+30SEC." to start cooking.

# Relevant feature in code:
# feature_list["microwave_cook"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_time_cook_button"]},
#     {"step": 2, "actions": meta_actions_on_number, "variable": "variable_time_cook_time", "comment": "requires parsing from variable_input_string"},
#     {"step": 3, "actions": ["press_power_button"]},
#     {"step": 4, "actions": meta_actions_on_number, "variable": "variable_power"},
#     {"step": 5, "actions": ["press_start_plus_30sec_button"]}
# ]

# Goal variable values:
# 1. Set `variable_time_cook_time` to "00:08:00".
# 2. Set `variable_power` to "PL9".
# 3. Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
