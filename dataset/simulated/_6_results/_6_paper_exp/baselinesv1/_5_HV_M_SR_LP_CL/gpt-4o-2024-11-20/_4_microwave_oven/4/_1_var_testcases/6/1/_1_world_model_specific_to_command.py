# The given code is accurate in modeling the features required to achieve the user command, according to the user manual. 
# Here's how the user command can be achieved step-by-step:

# Step 1: Set the function knob to "Lower & Upper Heater"
# - Relevant user manual text: "To reach quickly the temperature of 70 °C to 230 °C in the oven, set the function knob: 
# Operates the lower & upper heater at the same time selection..."
# - Relevant feature: feature_list["set_function_knob"]

# Step 2: Set the upper heater to 70 °C
# - Relevant user manual text: "Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs: Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C"
# - Relevant feature: feature_list["adjust_upper_heater_temperature"]

# Step 3: Set the lower heater to 70 °C
# - Relevant user manual text: "Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs: Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C"
# - Relevant feature: feature_list["adjust_lower_heater_temperature"]

# Step 4: Set the timer to "80" minutes (considering the numerical sequence nearest to 80, like 100)
# - Relevant user manual text: "Timer: The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches '0'..."
# - Relevant feature: feature_list["set_timer"]

# No missing features or variables. The goals match the modeled machine functionalities.
