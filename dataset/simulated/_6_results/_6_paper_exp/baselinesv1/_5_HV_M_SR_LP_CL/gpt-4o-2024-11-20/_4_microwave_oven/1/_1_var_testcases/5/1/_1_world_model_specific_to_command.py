# The given code already correctly models the required appliance features for the user command.
# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. "time_defrost" to set the time defrost to 20 minutes at 100% power:
#    - User manual excerpt: "Press 'TIME DEFROST', screen will display 'dEF2'. Press number pads to input defrosting time. The effective time range is 00:01~99:99."
#    - Feature in the code: feature_list["time_defrost"]
# 2. Set power level to 100% (PL10):
#    - User manual excerpt: "Press 'POWER', then press the number pad of the power level you wanted."
#    - Feature in the code: feature_list["time_defrost"]
# 3. "start_running" to initiate the operation:
#    - User manual excerpt: "Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start defrosting."
#    - Feature in the code: feature_list["time_defrost"]

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set `variable_time_defrost` to "00:20:00".
# - Set `variable_power` to "PL10".
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
