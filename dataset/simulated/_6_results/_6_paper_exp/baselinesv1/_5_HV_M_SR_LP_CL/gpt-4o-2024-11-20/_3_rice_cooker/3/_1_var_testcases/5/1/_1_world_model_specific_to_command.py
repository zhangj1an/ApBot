# The user command is: Adjust the delay timer to 10 hours, set the rice cooker to White Rice, and start running.

# According to the given code:
# 1. To adjust the delay timer, the feature `adjust_delay_timer` is used.
#    Feature: "adjust_delay_timer"
#    User manual text: "Press Delay Timer to delay the start of your cooker cycle. Use + and - to increase or decrease the desired start time, in increments of 30 minutes. Delay can be from 1 - 24 hours."
#    Code correctly models this feature.

# 2. To set the rice cooker to White Rice, the feature `set_menu` is used.
#    Feature: "set_menu"
#    User manual text: "Press menu button to scroll through preset functions, White Rice, Brown Rice, Quinoa, Steel Cut Oats."
#    Code correctly models this feature.

# 3. To start running, the feature `start_cooking` is used.
#    Feature: "start_cooking"
#    User manual text: "Press to start cooking."
#    Code correctly models this feature.

# Therefore, the current code accurately models the features required to achieve this command:
# - Adjust delay timer to 10 hours using "adjust_delay_timer".
# - Set the rice cooker to White Rice using "set_menu".
# - Start running using "start_cooking".

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - Set `variable_delay_timer` to 10 (10 hours).
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "White Rice".
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
