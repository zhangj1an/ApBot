# The requested command involves cooking jasmine rice with a preset time of 7 hours and starting the machine. 
# After reviewing the provided user manual and given code, the following observations are made:

# 1. Feature needed to set the preset time ("adjust_preset_time") exists in the code.
#    Relevant raw user manual text: 
#    
#    This feature is correctly implemented in the code as:
#    feature_list["adjust_preset_time"].

# 2. Feature for selecting the jasmine rice program is also present.
#    Relevant raw user manual text:
#    
#    This feature is correctly implemented in the code as:
#    feature_list["select_cooking_program"].

# 3. Feature to start the appliance exists in the code.
#    Relevant raw user manual text:
#    
#    This feature is correctly implemented in the code as:
#    feature_list["start_appliance"].

# 4. The variable `preset_time` is modeled appropriately as a continuous variable with maximum 24 hours.

# Conclusion: The current code is accurate and no modification is required to model the features.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# - Feature 1: "select_cooking_program" to select "jasmine_rice."
# - Feature 2: "adjust_preset_time" to set the preset time to 7 hours (420 minutes).
# - Feature 3: "start_appliance" to start the machine.

# Final variable values to achieve this command:
# - `variable_cooking_program` = "jasmine_rice."
# - `variable_preset_time` = 420 (corresponding to 7 hours in minutes).
# - `variable_start_running` = "on."

# Generating ExtendedSimulator as no changes are necessary.
