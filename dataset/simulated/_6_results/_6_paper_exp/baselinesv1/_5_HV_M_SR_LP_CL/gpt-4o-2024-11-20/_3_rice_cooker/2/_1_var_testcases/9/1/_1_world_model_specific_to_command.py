# The existing code sufficiently models the required features for the user command: 
# "Set the mode to cake, set the timer to three hours, and start the machine."
# Here's the reasoning step by step, verifying against user manual descriptions:

# 1. **Set the mode to cake**:
# - User manual: "Press Menu/Cancel button to choose mode: Fast cook, White rice, Congee, Soup, Cake, Keep warm."
# - Relevant feature: "select_cooking_mode", implemented in the feature list as:
# feature_list["select_cooking_mode"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_menu_cancel_button"], "variable": "variable_cooking_mode"}
# ]
# - Variable: "variable_cooking_mode" (DiscreteVariable with modes including 'cake').

# 2. **Set the timer to three hours**:
# - User manual: "Choose a function you need, press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer. With each press, the time increases by 15 minutes. The preset time is up to 24 hours."
# - Relevant feature: "adjust_preset_timer", implemented in the feature list as:
# feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_preset_time_time_button"], "variable": "variable_preset_timer"}
# ]
# - Variable: "variable_preset_timer" (ContinuousVariable with 15-minute increments up to 1440 minutes).

# 3. **Start the machine**:
# - User manual: "Press Start to start the cooking process."
# - Relevant feature: "start_cooking", implemented in the feature list as:
# feature_list["start_cooking"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button"], "variable": "variable_start_running", "comment": "value always set to on"}
# ]
# - Variable: "variable_start_running" (DiscreteVariable with "on" and "off").

# All the necessary features, variables, and actions for the command are already implemented accurately. Following is the sequence to achieve this command:
# 1) Use feature "select_cooking_mode" and set variable_cooking_mode to "cake".
# 2) Use feature "adjust_preset_timer" and set variable_preset_timer to "180" (3 hours in minutes).
# 3) Use feature "start_cooking" and set variable_start_running to "on".

# Goal variable values:
# - variable_cooking_mode: "cake"
# - variable_preset_timer: 180
# - variable_start_running: "on"

# Since no updates are needed, the code can remain unchanged.
