# The current code correctly models the relevant appliance features based on the user manual to achieve the user command:
# "Adjust the delay time to 2 hours, set the rice cooker to Brown Rice, and start running."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this user command:
# 1. Adjust the delay time to 2 hours:
#    Feature name in the current code: "adjust_delay_timer"
#    User manual text: "Press Delay Timer to delay the start of your cooker cycle. Use + and - to increase or decrease time in increments of 30 minutes. Delay can be from 1 - 24 hours."
#    Variable adjusted: variable_delay_timer
# 2. Set the rice cooker to Brown Rice:
#    Feature name in the current code: "set_menu"
#    User manual text: "Press Menu to select the desired function. Indicator light shows which function is selected."
#    Variables adjusted: variable_menu_index, variable_menu_setting
# 3. Start running:
#    Feature name in the current code: "start_cooking"
#    User manual text: "Press to start cooking."
#    Variable adjusted: variable_start_running

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_delay_timer to 2.0 (representing 2 hours).
# - Set variable_menu_index to "Brown Rice".
# - Set variable_menu_setting to variable_menu_setting_brown_rice (initialized accordingly).
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".

# No changes required in the current code as it correctly models all these features, variables, and actions.
