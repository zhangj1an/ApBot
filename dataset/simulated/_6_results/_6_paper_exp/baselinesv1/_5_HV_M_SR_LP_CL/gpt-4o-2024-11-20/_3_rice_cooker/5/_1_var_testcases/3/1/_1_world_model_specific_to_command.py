# Python comments outlining the evaluation of the given code against the user command:
# The user command needs to: 
# 1. Turn on the cooker, which corresponds to the feature "start_appliance".
# 2. Set the cooker to "brown rice mode", which corresponds to the feature "select_cooking_program". 
# 3. Set a preset time of 5 hours, which corresponds to the feature "adjust_preset_time".
# 4. Start the machine, which corresponds back to the "start_appliance" feature.

# The provided code models these actions with the following features:
# - "start_appliance": Correctly models pressing the start button to let the appliance start (sets `variable_start_running` to "on").
# - "select_cooking_program": Correctly models selecting the cooking program (adjusts `variable_cooking_program`).
# - "adjust_preset_time": Correctly models adjusting the preset time (adjusts `variable_preset_time`).
# 
# The code already includes all relevant features needed to achieve the requested sequence of operations. 
# The goal values are:
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
# - Set `variable_cooking_program` to "brown_rice".
# - Set `variable_preset_time` to 300 (5 hours in minutes).

# Since the current code is already accurate, simply extend the Simulator class without changes, as follows:

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator): 
    pass
