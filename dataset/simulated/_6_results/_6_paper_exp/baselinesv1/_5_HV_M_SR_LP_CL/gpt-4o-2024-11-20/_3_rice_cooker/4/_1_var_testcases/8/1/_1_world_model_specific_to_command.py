# The required command can already be achieved with the existing code. Here's the validation of the command:

# **Sequence of Features Needed**:
# 1. Adjust the menu to "STEW" (feature: "set_menu").
# 2. Set the reservation timer (delay time) to 4 hours (feature: "set_delay_time").
# 3. Start the machine (feature: "start_cooking").

# **Relevant User Manual Text**:
# - Adjusting the Menu:
#   "Press the MENU button to select the desired cooking function (e.g., STEW)."
#   This is covered by the feature: `"set_menu"`.
# - Setting Reservation Time (Delay):
#   "Press the DELAY button, then adjust the reservation time using the delay button."
#   This is covered by the feature: `"set_delay_time"`.
# - Start Cooking:
#   "Press the START button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."
#   This is covered by the feature: `"start_cooking"`.

# **Feature List Name in the Given Code**:
# - "set_menu" (to select "STEW").
# - "set_delay_time" (to set the delay time to 4 hours).
# - "start_cooking" (to start the machine).

# **Goal Variable Values**:
# - `variable_menu_index`: `"stew"`.
# - `variable_delay_time`: `4`.
# - `variable_start_running`: `"on"`.

# Since all the required features and variables are already modeled accurately in the given code, no changes are needed to the existing Simulator.
