# The following code is generated after verifying the given user manual and existing Simulator.

# Python comment:
# The given code is accurate in modeling the required features for the provided user command: 
# "Turn on and cook brown rice with a preset finish time in 9 hours. Then start the machine."
# The required sequence of features to achieve this command is:
# 1. "select_cooking_program" - Set the cooking program to "brown_rice".
# 2. "adjust_preset_time" - Set the preset finish time to 9 hours (540 minutes).
# 3. "start_appliance" - Start the machine.
# 
# Relevant raw user manual text:
# - **Cooking Program Selection**: Cooking programs such as jasmine rice, white rice, brown rice, etc., can be selected by their respective buttons.
# - **Preset Time Feature**: When the cooking program is chosen, press the preset button to set the time for finishing cooking.
# - **Start Button**: Press the start button to start cooking.
#
# Relevant feature_list names in the given code:
# - "select_cooking_program": [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_jasmine_rice_button", "press_white_rice_button", ... "press_reheat_button"], "variable": "variable_cooking_program"}]
# - "adjust_preset_time": [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_preset_button"], "variable": "variable_preset_time"}]
# - "start_appliance": [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button"], "variable": "variable_start_running", "comment": "value always set to on"}]
#
# The goal variable values to achieve the command are:
# - variable_cooking_program should be set to "brown_rice".
# - variable_preset_time should be set to 540 (equivalent to 9 hours).
# - variable_start_running should be set to "on".
