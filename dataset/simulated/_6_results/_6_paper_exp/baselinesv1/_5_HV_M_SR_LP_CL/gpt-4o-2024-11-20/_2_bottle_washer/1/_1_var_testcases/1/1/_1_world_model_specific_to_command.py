# The given command is to turn on the machine and set it to automatic sterilize and dry for 30 minutes.

# Based on the user manual:
# - User manual: "Press the On/Off (power symbol) button once and the function icons will light up."
# - Corresponds to feature_list["activate_sterilizer"] and variable_power_on_off.
# - For the drying time of 30 minutes for automatic sterilize/dry:
#   - User manual: "Press the Sterilize/Dry button 1 time for 30 minute dry time..."
#   - Corresponds to feature_list["automatic_sterilize_dry_time"] and variable_dry_time.

# Features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Feature "activate_sterilizer" to turn on the power.
# 2. Feature "automatic_sterilize_dry_time" to set the drying time to 30 minutes.

# Verified variables and features in code:
# - The required variable `variable_power_on_off` exists with options "on" and "off".
# - The required variable `variable_dry_time` exists with options ["0", "30", "45", "60"].
# - The `feature_list["activate_sterilizer"]` and `feature_list["automatic_sterilize_dry_time"]` correctly model the actions.

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" (turn on the appliance).
# - Set `variable_dry_time` to "30" (set drying time to 30 minutes).
