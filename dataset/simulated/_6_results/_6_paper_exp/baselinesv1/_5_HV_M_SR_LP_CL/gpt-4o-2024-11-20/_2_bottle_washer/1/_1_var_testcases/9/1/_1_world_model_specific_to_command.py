# Python comments for verification:
# The provided code correctly models the procedure for switching on the device, selecting the drying time for the automatic sterilize/dry cycle, and ensures sterilization and drying can be achieved properly as per the user manual.
# Relevant features in the given code:
# 1. "activate_sterilizer" to switch on the device (variable: variable_power_on_off).
# 2. "automatic_sterilize_dry_time" to set the drying time for sterilization and drying (variable: variable_dry_time).
# Raw user manual text relevant to this command:
# - "Press the On/Off (power symbol) button once and the function icons will light up."
# - "Automatic Sterilize/Dry Function: Choose the drying time (after steam sterilization). Press the Sterilize/Dry button 1 time for 30 minute dry time, 2 times for 45 minute dry time, 3 times for 60 minute dry time."
# Verified that the code correctly defines the variables and features.
# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set "variable_power_on_off" to "on".
# - Set "variable_dry_time" to "45".
