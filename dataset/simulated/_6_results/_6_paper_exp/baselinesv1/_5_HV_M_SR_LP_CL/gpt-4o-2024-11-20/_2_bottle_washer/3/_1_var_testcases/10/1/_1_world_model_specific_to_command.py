# Python Comments:
# According to the user manual, the task is: Power up, select 'Sterilize & Dry', and press start to begin.
# Let's validate the existing code against the description in the user manual.

# User Manual Guidance:
# 1. Powering up — User Manual: "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."
# 2. Selecting 'Sterilize & Dry' — User Manual: "Sterilize & Dry: Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 1 time, then press the Start/Pause button to start."
# 3. Pressing Start — User Manual: "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."

# Documented Code Review:
# - Relevant features identified:
#   "power_control" for powering on the device.
#   "choose_sterilize_dry_mode" for selecting the 'Sterilize & Dry' cycle.
#   "start_cycle" for starting the process.

# - All required feature steps are included in the given code:
#   a. Powering up the appliance is correctly modeled in "power_control."
#   b. Selecting the 'Sterilize & Dry' mode is correctly outlined in "choose_sterilize_dry_mode."
#   c. Starting the process is modeled in "start_cycle."

# - Goal Variable Values:
#   1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" (feature: "power_control").
#   2. Set `variable_sterilize_dry_mode` to "Sterilize & Dry" (feature: "choose_sterilize_dry_mode").
#   3. Set `variable_start_running` to "on" (feature: "start_cycle").
