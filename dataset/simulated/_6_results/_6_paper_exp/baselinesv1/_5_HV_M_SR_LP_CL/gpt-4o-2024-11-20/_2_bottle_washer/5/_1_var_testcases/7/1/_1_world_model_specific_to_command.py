# The original code correctly models the following relevant features from the user manual for the given user command:
# - Power the washer on: Modeled through "power_on_off" feature with `variable_power_on_off`.
# - Perform a short sterilization cycle for 10 minutes: Modeled through "sterilise_only_function" feature with `variable_sterilise_only_duration`.
# - Keep it in storage mode: Modeled through the "storage_function" feature with `variable_storage_mode`.

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Feature: "power_on_off"
#    - Activate the steriliser by toggling `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
#    - User Manual: "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off."
# 2. Feature: "sterilise_only_function"
#    - Set the `variable_sterilise_only_duration` to "10 minutes".
#    - User Manual: "Choose your function based on the type of products you are sterilising. 10 minutes and 35 minutes auto cycles are for clear bottles only."
# 3. Feature: "storage_function"
#    - Toggle `variable_storage_mode` to "on".
#    - User Manual: "Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser."

# Goal Variable Values:
# - `variable_power_on_off` = "on"
# - `variable_sterilise_only_duration` = "10 minutes"
# - `variable_storage_mode` = "on"
