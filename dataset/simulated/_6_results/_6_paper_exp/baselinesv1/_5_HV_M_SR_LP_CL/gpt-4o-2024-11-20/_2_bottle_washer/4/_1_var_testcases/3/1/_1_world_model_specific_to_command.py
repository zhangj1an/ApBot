# The given code models the appliance features as per the user manual instructions. 
# The necessary steps to achieve the user command of turning the bottle warmer on and using the defrost function for 5 minutes are correctly represented.
# The sequence of features needed to execute the command is as follows:
# 1. Turn on the appliance: Use the feature "turn_on_off_appliance" with action "press_power_button."
# 2. Set the menu to "Defrost": Use the feature "set_and_adjust_menu" with action "press_menu_button."
# 3. Adjust the defrost time to 5 minutes: Use the feature "set_and_adjust_menu" with action "press_plus_button" or "press_minus_button."

# Raw user manual text relevant to the features:
# 1. Turn on/off: "Tap the power button to shut down the appliance."
# 2. Set menu: "Tap the menu button to cycle through various function modes ('Quick', 'Slow', 'Defrost', 'Sterilize', 'Steam', 'Preset')."
# 3. Adjust settings: "Adjust the time using the +/- buttons."

# Relevant feature list in the code:
# feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]
# feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_menu_button"], "variable": "variable_menu_index"},
#     {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_plus_button", "press_minus_button"], "variable": "variable_menu_setting"}
# ]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. Set variable_power_on_off to "on."
# 2. Set variable_menu_index to "Defrost."
# 3. Set variable_menu_setting (defrost time) to 5.
