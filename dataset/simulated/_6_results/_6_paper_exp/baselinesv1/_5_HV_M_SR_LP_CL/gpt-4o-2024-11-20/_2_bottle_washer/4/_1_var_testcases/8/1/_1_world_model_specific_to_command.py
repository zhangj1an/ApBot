# The current code correctly models the relevant features from the user manual to achieve the user command:
# "Activate the bottle warmer, choose the defrost function, and set the time required to 8 minutes for thawing."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# Step 1: Activate the appliance by pressing the power button (feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"]).
# Raw user manual text: "Tap the power button then tap the menu button until the sterilizer option appears."
# Step 2: Select the "Defrost" option from the menu using the menu button (feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"]).
# Raw user manual text: "Tap the menu button to cycle through various function modes."
# Step 3: Adjust the "Defrost" time to 8 minutes using the plus and minus buttons (feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"]).
# Raw user manual text: "Using the +/- adjust a time needed for defrosting."

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_menu_index = "Defrost"
# - variable_menu_setting_defrost = 8
