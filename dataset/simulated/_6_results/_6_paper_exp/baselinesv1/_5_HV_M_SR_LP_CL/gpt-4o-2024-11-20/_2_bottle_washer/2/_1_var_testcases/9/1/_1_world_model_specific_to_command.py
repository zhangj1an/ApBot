# The current implementation of the code adequately models the appliance features, allowing the completion of the user command:
# "Power on the appliance and set it for a silicone bottle, frozen (0℃), with a volume of 1-3 fl-oz."
# Below is the sequence of features needed, along with user manual references and goal variable values:

# Sequence of features to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use "power_and_start_warming" feature to power on the appliance.
# 2. Use "select_bottle_type" feature to set the bottle type to "Silicone".
# 3. Use "select_initial_temperature" feature to set the initial temperature to "Frozen".
# 4. Use "select_volume" feature to set the volume to "1-3 fl-oz".

# Relevant raw user manual texts:
# 1. **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off.
