# User command review:
# The requested user command is to make a basic loaf with a medium crust for breakfast, loaf size is 1.5lb, 
# set the delay timer to 10 hours from now, and start the bread maker.
# Here is the relevant check against the user manual.

# User manual quotes:
# **1. MENU**: "The Menu button is used to select a program... Select your desired program." -> `'adjust_menu'`.
# **2. COLOR**: "Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust." -> `'adjust_crust_color'`.
# **3. LOAF SIZE**: "Press this button to select the desired size of the loaf." -> `'adjust_loaf_size'`.
# **4. DELAY FUNCTION**: "Use this button to delay the start time for your desired program." -> `'adjust_delay_time'`.
# **5. START/STOP**: "This button is used for starting and stopping the selected baking program." -> `'start_stop_bread_maker'`.

# Current code check:
# The given code correctly models all required variables and features to achieve this command:
# - `adjust_menu` to select menu "Basic".
# - `adjust_crust_color` to set crust color to "Medium".
# - `adjust_loaf_size` to select loaf size "1.5LB".
# - `adjust_delay_time` to set delay timer to "10 hours" (600 mins).
# - `start_stop_bread_maker` to start the bread maker.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. `adjust_menu`: Set `variable_menu_index` to `"Basic"`.
# 2. `adjust_crust_color`: Set `variable_crust_color` to `"Medium"`.
# 3. `adjust_loaf_size`: Set `variable_loaf_size` to `"1.5LB"`.
# 4. `adjust_delay_time`: Set `variable_delay_time` to `600` (10 hours).
# 5. `start_stop_bread_maker`: Set `variable_start_running` to `"on"`.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - `variable_menu_index = "Basic"`
# - `variable_crust_color = "Medium"`
# - `variable_loaf_size = "1.5LB"`
# - `variable_delay_time = 600`
# - `variable_start_running = "on"`
