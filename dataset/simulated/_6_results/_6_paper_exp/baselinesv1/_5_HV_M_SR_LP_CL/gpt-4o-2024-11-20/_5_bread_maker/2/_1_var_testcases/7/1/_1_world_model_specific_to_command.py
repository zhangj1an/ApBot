# The provided code correctly models the command using the following sequence of features and actions.
# Step 1 - Select the desired menu (i.e., Dough) and set its specific setting.
# Related feature and variable: "set_menu_and_setting", "variable_menu_index", and "variable_menu_setting".
# User manual: "Choose the desired setting from the list by pressing the Menu button."

# Step 2 - Adjust the loaf size to "large".
# Related feature and variable: "adjust_loaf_size", "variable_loaf_size".
# User manual: "Press Loaf size button to choose between small or large."

# Step 3 - Adjust the crust color to "light." Note for programs like the dough setting, crust adjustment may not be relevant but has been modeled.
# Related feature and variable: "adjust_crust_color", "variable_crust_color".
# User manual: "Choose desired crust color by pressing Colour button."

# Step 4 - Adjust the timer delay to 3 hours.
# Related feature and variable: "adjust_timer_delay", "variable_timer_delay."

# Step 5 - Start the bread maker.
# Related feature and variable: "start_stop_operation", "variable_start_running."
# User manual: "Press Start Stop button to start the machine."

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# - variable_menu_index = "8" (Dough setting)
# - variable_menu_setting = "1:30:00" (Default dough setting time)
# - variable_timer_delay = "03:00:00" (3 hours timer delay)
# - variable_crust_color = "light" (If applicable)
# - variable_loaf_size = "2LB" (Large loaf)
# - variable_start_running = "on" (Start the bread maker)
