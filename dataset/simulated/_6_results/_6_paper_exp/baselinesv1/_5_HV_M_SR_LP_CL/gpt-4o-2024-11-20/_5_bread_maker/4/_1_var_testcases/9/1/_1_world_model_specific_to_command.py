# The current code correctly models the appliance features and variables, allowing for the user command 
# to be achieved accurately. Below is the verification:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. "activate_gluten_free_mode" (Set gluten-free mode using `press_gluten_free_button`)
# 2. "set_auto_menu" (Set the Sweet menu using `press_menu_button` until reaching Sweet)
# 3. "adjust_timer" (Set the timer delay to 3 hours using `press_timer_up_button` until correct value is reached)
# 4. "adjust_loaf_size" (Set loaf size to 900g using `press_loaf_size_button`)
# 5. "adjust_crust_color" (Set crust color to Medium using `press_crust_colour_button`)
# 6. "start_or_cancel_program" (Start the program using `press_start_cancel_button`)

# User manual text relevant to these features:
# - Gluten-Free: "Press to go directly to the gluten free bread function."
# - Adjusting menu and settings: "Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown..."
# - Timer Delay: "Press TIMER button to change the start time on the bread maker. Press up arrow to increase the time in increments."
# - Loaf Size: "To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g..."
# - Crust Color: "To change the crust color, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark..."
# - Starting program: "Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program."

# Feature list names in the code: 
# "activate_gluten_free_mode", "set_auto_menu", "adjust_timer", "adjust_loaf_size", "adjust_crust_color", "start_or_cancel_program"

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_gluten_free_mode`: "on"
# - `variable_menu_index`: "Sweet"
# - `variable_timer`: "03:00:00"
# - `variable_loaf_size`: "900g"
# - `variable_crust_color`: "Medium"
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"

# Since the current code fully supports the sequence of steps required by the user command, no modifications or new features are needed.
