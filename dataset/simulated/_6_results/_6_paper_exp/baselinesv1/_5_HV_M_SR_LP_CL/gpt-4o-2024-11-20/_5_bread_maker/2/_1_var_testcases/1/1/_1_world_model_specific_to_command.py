# The provided code already models the appliance features required to achieve the command 
# "Bake a large, medium-crust French loaf using the French menu, with a 2-hour timer delay, then start the bread maker." correctly.
# Here is how it maps:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Set the menu to "French" - this is modelled in the "set_menu_and_setting" feature.
#    User manual: "Choose desired setting from the list by pressing the Menu button."
#    Feature: "set_menu_and_setting"
#
# 2. Set the crust color to "medium" - this is modelled in the "adjust_crust_color" feature.
#    User manual: "Choose desired crust colour by pressing Colour button."
#    Feature: "adjust_crust_color"
#
# 3. Set the loaf size to "2LB" - this is modelled in the "adjust_loaf_size" feature.
#    User manual: "Press Loaf size button to choose between small or large."
#    Feature: "adjust_loaf_size"
#
# 4. Set the timer delay to 2:00:00 - this is modelled in the "adjust_timer_delay" feature.
#    User manual: "Use the timer when you want the bread ready later. A maximum of 13 hours can be set."
#    Feature: "adjust_timer_delay"
#
# 5. Start the bread maker - this is modelled in the "start_stop_operation" feature.
#    User manual: "Press Start for approx. 1 second... the program starts."
#    Feature: "start_stop_operation"

# Goal variable values:
# - variable_menu_index: "2" (French menu)
# - variable_menu_setting: ["0:00:00", ..., "3:50:00"] (associated with French menu)
# - variable_crust_color: "medium"
