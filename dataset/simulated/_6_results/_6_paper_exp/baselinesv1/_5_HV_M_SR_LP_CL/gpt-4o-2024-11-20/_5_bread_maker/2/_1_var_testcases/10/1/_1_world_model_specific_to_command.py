# Python comment: The given code has accurately modelled the features allowing the bread maker to set the menu, adjust the crust color, adjust the loaf size, set the timer delay, and start the operation correctly. Below is the required sequence of features and goal variable values to complete the task.

# Sequence of features to achieve the user command:
# 1. Set the menu to "Fastbake I".
# 2. Adjust the loaf size to "2LB" (large).
# 3. Adjust the crust color to "medium".
# 4. Set the timer delay to "2:00:00".
# 5. Start the bread maker.
#
# Corresponding steps in the feature list:
# - "set_menu_and_setting": Adjust `variable_menu_index` to "6" (Fastbake I menu).
# - "adjust_loaf_size": Adjust `variable_loaf_size` to "2LB".
# - "adjust_crust_color": Adjust `variable_crust_color` to "medium".
# - "adjust_timer_delay": Adjust `variable_timer_delay` to "2:00:00".
# - "start_stop_operation": Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
#
# Relevant user manual text:
# - **Menu Selection:**
#   "For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12."
# - **Crust Color:**
#   "For selecting crust color from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
# - **Loaf Size:**
#   "For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)."
# - **Timer Delay:**
#   "Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)."
# - **Start/Stop Operation:**
#   "Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds, and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts."

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_menu_index`: "6" (Fastbake I).
# - `variable_loaf_size`: "2LB".
# - `variable_crust_color`: "medium".
# - `variable_timer_delay`: "2:00:00".
# - `variable_start_running`: "on".
