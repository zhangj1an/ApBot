# User Command Review:
# The user command implies using the appliance to set a Quick program, select loaf size to 700g,
# set crust color to Light, set delay timer to 11 hours, and start the operation.
# I'll verify if the provided code correctly models these features.

# Step-by-step feature analysis:
# -- Verify program selection via "menu" feature.
# User manual text: "Press the MENU button repeatedly to cycle through the options below."
# Code models this with variable_menu_index in feature_list["set_menu"] and relevant action effects. ✅

# -- Verify loaf size selection.
# User manual text: "Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed)."
# Code uses variable_loaf_size in feature_list["set_loaf_size"]. ✅

# -- Verify crust color selection.
# User manual text: "Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed)."
# Code uses variable_crust_color in feature_list["set_crust_color"]. ✅

# -- Verify delay timer adjustment.
# User manual text: "Use these buttons when you would like to delay the completion of your bread."
# Code correctly models this with variable_delay_timer in feature_list["set_delay_timer"]. ✅

# -- Verify start/stop functionality.
# User manual text: "Press START/STOP button to start or stop the Programmes."
# Code models variable_start_running in feature_list["start_stop_program"], toggling between 'on' and 'off'. ✅

# Sequence to achieve user command:
# 1. Navigate to Quick program using feature "set_menu" (variable_menu_index: "4").
# 2. Adjust loaf size to "700g" using feature "set_loaf_size."
# 3. Set crust color to "Light" using feature "set_crust_color."
# 4. Set delay timer to 11 hours (660 minutes) using feature "set_delay_timer."
# 5. Start the program using "start_stop_program." 

# The provided code correctly models all features required to achieve the command.
