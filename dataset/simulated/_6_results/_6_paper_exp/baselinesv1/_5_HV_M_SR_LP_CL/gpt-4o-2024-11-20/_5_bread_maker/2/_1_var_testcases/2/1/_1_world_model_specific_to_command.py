# Checking the user command against the given user manual and code.

# The user command is:
# Start a small, dark-crust wholewheat loaf using wholewheat menu, with 2-hour timer delay, then start the bread maker.

# Analysis:
# Per the given user manual, the appliance allows setting the following:
# - Menu (variable_menu_index): Choose "Wholewheat" (menu index 3).
# - Crust color (variable_crust_color): Select "dark".
# - Loaf size (variable_loaf_size): Choose "small" (1.5LB).
# - Timer delay (variable_timer_delay): Set to 2-hour delay (02:00:00).
# - Start operation (variable_start_running): Activate the bread maker.

# Steps in the feature list are clear and accurately modeled in the given code:
# 1. "set_menu_and_setting": Allows selecting the menu program (variable_menu_index).
# 2. "adjust_crust_color": Allows setting crust color (variable_crust_color).
# 3. "adjust_loaf_size": Allows selecting the loaf size (variable_loaf_size).
# 4. "adjust_timer_delay": Allows adjusting the timer delay (variable_timer_delay).
# 5. "start_stop_operation": Allows toggling start/stop operation (variable_start_running).

# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance functionality to achieve the command. All necessary variables
# and features are included. No additional variables or features need to be added or modified.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "set_menu_and_setting" to select the "Wholewheat" menu (index 3).
