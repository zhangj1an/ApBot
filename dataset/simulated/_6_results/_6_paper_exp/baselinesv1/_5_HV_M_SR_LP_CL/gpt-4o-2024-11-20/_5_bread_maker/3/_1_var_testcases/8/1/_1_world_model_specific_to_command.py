# The current implementation of the features and variables in the Simulator is already accurate and includes the necessary functions.

# Features needed to achieve the user command:
# - "select_cycle": Set the cycle to "Sweet".
# - "adjust_crust_color": Set the crust color to "Medium".
# - "adjust_loaf_size": Set the loaf size to "2-lb".
# - "adjust_delay_timer": Set the delay timer to 10 hours.
# - "start_or_stop_operation": Start the bread maker.

# Relevant user manual text:
# 1. "Press CYCLE button until desired program number appears on the digital display."
# 2. "Press CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust."
# 3. "Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size."
# 4. "Use the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time."
# 5. "Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle."

# Features in the provided code:
# - feature_list["select_cycle"]
# - feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
# - feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
# - feature_list["adjust_delay_timer"]
# - feature_list["start_or_stop_operation"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# 1. variable_cycle set to "Sweet".
# 2. variable_crust_color set to "Medium".
# 3. variable_loaf_size set to "2.0lb".
# 4. variable_delay_timer set to 600 (10 hours in minutes).
# 5. variable_start_running set to "on".
