# The provided code models most of the appliance's features described in the user manual. 
# However, it misses a critical step for steam cooking specific to the user command: setting the time for steam function to 13 minutes as mentioned in the user command. This step involves utilizing the steam cooking function (manual provides "Steam" as one of the modes). The existing feature "set_and_adjust_menu" allows switching to the "Steam" mode and adjusting its time. This is already covered. 

# Sequence of Features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Turn on the appliance using the feature "turn_on_off_appliance."
# 2. Use the feature "set_and_adjust_menu" to switch to "Steam" mode.
# 3. Adjust the steam time for "Steam" mode using the same feature "set_and_adjust_menu."

# Relevant User Manual Text:
# - "Tap the menu button until the desired mode appears."
# - "The steam function uses steam to cook food, with a default time of 12 minutes adjustable using '+/-'."
# - "Tap the power button to turn the appliance on or off."

# Feature List and the corresponding names in code:
# - "turn_on_off_appliance"
# - "set_and_adjust_menu"

# Goal Variable Values to Achieve User Command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" (turns on the appliance).
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "Steam" (select Steam function).
# - Set `variable_menu_setting_steam` (Steam time) to 13 (adjust Steam time to 13 minutes using '+' button).
