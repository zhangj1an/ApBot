# The current code correctly models all the variables and features necessary to achieve the user command. 
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is: 
# 1. "drying_only_function" - to set the drying duration to 50 minutes.
# 2. "storage_function" - to turn on the storage mode.

# Relevant user manual texts: 
# For "drying_only_function":
# Press this button once for 30 minutes drying, twice for 40 minutes drying and three times for 50 minutes drying.
# For "storage_function":
# Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser. The steriliser will run a programme that emits 5 minutes of UV light and 5 minutes of drying every 2 hours, to ensure items inside remain sterile.

# Feature list names in the current code:
# - "drying_only_function"
# - "storage_function"
