# The given code has correctly modeled the following steps:
# 1. Activating the device is part of the feature "activate_sterilizer" using the "press_on_off_button" action.
# 2. Initiating the dry-only function and adjusting the dry time is modeled with the "dryer_only_time" feature using the "press_dry_only_button" action, which updates the variable "variable_dryer_only_time".

# Relevant user manual excerpts:
# - "Press the On/Off (power symbol) button once and the function icons will light up. If there is no selection of function after pressing on/off button, the appliance will automatically switch off."
# - "Dryer only function: Press the Dry button 1 time for 30-minute dry time, 2 times for 45-minute dry time, and 3 times for 60-minute dry time."
# These aspects align with the current code's variable and feature implementation.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Execute "activate_sterilizer" to turn the power "on".
# 2. Execute "dryer_only_time" to set the dry-only function to 30 minutes.

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_dryer_only_time`: "30"
