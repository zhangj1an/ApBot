# Check if the current implementation correctly models the necessary appliance features described in the user command.
# The following user manual text describes the features required:
#
# User manual: **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off.
#               Feature: power_and_start_warming
#
# User manual: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#              |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#              | Milk bag      | Room- 25℃ (77℉)           | 1-3 fl- oz    |
#              | Plastic       | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2℉)        | 4-6 fl- oz    |
#              | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl- oz     |
#               Features: select_bottle_type, select_initial_temperature, select_volume
#
# User command requires:
# 1. Turning the appliance on.
# 2. Selecting the bottle type as "Silicone".
# 3. Selecting the initial temperature as "Refrig".
# 4. Setting the volume to "4-6 fl-oz".
#
# Based on the given code:
# - All required variables are correctly modeled.
# - The features "power_and_start_warming", "select_bottle_type", "select_initial_temperature", and "select_volume" are correctly modeled for achieving the command.
# - The steps to achieve the command can be followed with the current implementation.

# Sequence of features to achieve the user command:
# 1. Turn the appliance ON using the feature "power_and_start_warming".
# 2. Select "Silicone" as the bottle type using the feature "select_bottle_type".
# 3. Set the initial temperature to "Refrig" using the feature "select_initial_temperature".
# 4. Set the volume to "4-6 fl-oz" using the feature "select_volume".

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_bottle_type = "Silicone"
# variable_initial_temp = "Refrig"
# variable_volume = "4-6 fl-oz"
