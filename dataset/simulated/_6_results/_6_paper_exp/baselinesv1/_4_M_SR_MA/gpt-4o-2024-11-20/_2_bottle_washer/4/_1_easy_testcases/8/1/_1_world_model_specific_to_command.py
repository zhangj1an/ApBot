# The given code correctly models the procedure to activate the bottle warmer, select the Defrost function, and set the corresponding time to 8 minutes. Below is the validation and reasoning:

# 1. Relevant feature: "turn_on_off_appliance" models the activation of the bottle warmer.
#    Relevant user manual text quote:
#    > "Tap the power button to shut down the appliance."
#    Existing feature in the code: `feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"]`

# 2. Relevant feature: "set_and_adjust_menu" models the steps for selecting the Defrost function and setting the required time.
#    Relevant user manual text quote:
#    > "Tap the menu button until the defrost function appears. Using the +/- adjust a time needed for defrosting."
#    Existing feature in the code: `feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"]`

# Since the appliance already includes the necessary features to execute the desired command, no updates are required for this code. The actions and variables are sufficient to perform the sequence of steps.

# Step-by-step sequence to achieve the command:
# - Follow feature: "turn_on_off_appliance" -> Press power button to turn on the appliance.
# - Follow feature: "set_and_adjust_menu" -> Press menu button to select "Defrost" -> Press +/- buttons to set time to 8 minutes.

# Corresponding goal variable values:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_menu_index`: "Defrost"
# - `variable_menu_setting`: 8 (minutes)
