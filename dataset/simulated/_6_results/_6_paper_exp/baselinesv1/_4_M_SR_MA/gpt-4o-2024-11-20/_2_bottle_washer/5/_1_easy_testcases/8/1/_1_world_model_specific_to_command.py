# The provided command is "Enable the washer for a 50-minute drying and keep sterile items in storage mode."

# The following features and variables are relevant for achieving this command:
# 1. Adjust drying time to 50 minutes: "drying_only_function" (variable: variable_drying_only_duration)
#    Raw user manual text:
#    **Drying only function**
#    Press this button once for 30 minutes drying, twice for 40 minutes drying and three times for 50 minutes drying.
# 
# 2. Enable storage mode: "storage_function" (variable: variable_storage_mode)
#    Raw user manual text:
#    **Storage function**
#    Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser. The steriliser will run a programme that emits 5 minutes of UV light and 5 minutes of drying every 2 hours, to ensure items inside remain sterile.

# The feature_list provided in the original code already contains:
# - Feature "drying_only_function"
# - Feature "storage_function"
# 
# Each step and action in these features clearly models the required actions to achieve the command:
# - "press_drying_only_button" to adjust drying time.
# - "press_storage_button" to enable storage mode.

# To achieve the command, the sequence of features is:
# 1. "drying_only_function" to set variable_drying_only_duration to "50 minutes".
# 2. "storage_function" to set variable_storage_mode to "on". 

# Goal Variable Values:
# variable_drying_only_duration = "50 minutes"
# variable_storage_mode = "on"
