# The current implementation provided above seems to accurately model the necessary appliance features for executing the user command:
# "Power up, select 'Sterilize & Dry', and press start to begin."

# The sequence to achieve this command with the current features is as follows:
# 1. Use the "power_control" feature to turn on the appliance.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    Corresponding feature: "power_control".
# 2. Use the "choose_sterilize_dry_mode" feature to select 'Sterilize & Dry' mode.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 1 time, then press the Start/Pause button to start."
#    Corresponding feature: "choose_sterilize_dry_mode".
# 3. Use the "start_cycle" feature to press start and begin the operation.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    Corresponding feature: "start_cycle".

# The variables involved in achieving this command are:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: Set to "on".
# - `variable_sterilize_dry_mode`: Set to "Sterilize & Dry".
# - `variable_start_running`: Set to "on".
