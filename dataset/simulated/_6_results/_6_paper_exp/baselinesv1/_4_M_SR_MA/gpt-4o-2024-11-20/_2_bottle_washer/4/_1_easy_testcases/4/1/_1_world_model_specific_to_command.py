# The requested user command involves switching the appliance on, selecting the sterilize function, and setting the cycle time to 20 minutes using 130 ml of water. 
# Based on the given user manual and the provided code, here we review the accuracy of the existing code:

# User manual relevant text:
# 1. "Tap the power button then tap the menu button until the sterilizer option appears."
#    This corresponds to turning on the appliance and selecting the sterilizer function.
# 2. "The default time is 15 minutes. The sterilizer function has three settings 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Use +/- to adjust the time."
#    This corresponds to setting the sterilizer time to 20 minutes using the +/- buttons.

# The provided code correctly models:
#   - Turning the appliance on/off using feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"].
#   - Selecting the sterilize function via the menu button using feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"].
#   - Adjusting the sterilizer function time ("20 minutes" is achievable via variable_menu_setting_sterilize).

# Listed sequence of features to achieve the user command:
# 1. Execute feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"] to switch the appliance on.
# 2. Execute feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"]. 
#    Step 1: Press the menu button until the sterilizer option is selected.
#    Step 2: Use the +/- buttons to adjust the cycle time to 20 minutes.

# Feature list ("turn_on_off_appliance" and "set_and_adjust_menu") correctly models this process.

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "Sterilize".
# - Set `variable_menu_setting_sterilize` to "20".

# No further modifications required. The original implementation is accurate to execute this command.
