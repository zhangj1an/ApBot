# The user command requires the use of the sterilizing function, setting the time to 15 minutes. 
# After reviewing the user manual and the given code, the current implementation accurately models the relevant features and variables needed to achieve the command. 

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Turn the appliance on with the "press_power_button" action (feature: "turn_on_off_appliance").
# 2. Select the sterilizing function using the "press_menu_button" action (feature: "set_and_adjust_menu").
# 3. Adjust the sterilizer time to "15" using the "press_plus_button" or "press_minus_button" actions (feature: "set_and_adjust_menu").

# Relevant user manual text:
# - "Tap the power button. All options will appear on the screen."
# - "Tap the menu button until the sterilizer option appears."
# - "The sterilizer function has three settings: 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Use +/- to adjust the time."

# Relevant features modeled in the given code:
# Feature: "turn_on_off_appliance"
# Feature: "set_and_adjust_menu"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_menu_index to "Sterilize".
# - Set variable_menu_setting to "15" (corresponding to sterilizer time).
