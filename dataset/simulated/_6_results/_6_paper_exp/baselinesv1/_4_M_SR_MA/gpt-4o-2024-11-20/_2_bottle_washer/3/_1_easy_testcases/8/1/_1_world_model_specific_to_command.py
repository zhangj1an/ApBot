# The current code seems accurate in modeling the appliance features applicable to the given user command:
# "Switch on, select 'Wash, Sterilize, Dry', and begin the washing procedure."
#
# Here is the step-by-step verification:
#
# 1. Switch on: This corresponds to the "power_control" feature, which toggles the power using the `press_and_hold_power_button` action.
#    User Manual: "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    Feature in Code: `feature_list["power_control"]`
#
# 2. Select 'Wash, Sterilize, Dry': This aligns with the "choose_wash_mode" feature, where the `press_wash_mode_button` cycles through wash modes.
#    User Manual: "Touch the 'wash mode' button to choose a wash cycle."
#    Feature in Code: `feature_list["choose_wash_mode"]`
#
# 3. Begin the washing procedure: This corresponds to the "start_cycle" feature, which toggles the start process using the `press_start_pause_button` action.
#    User Manual: "Touch the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."
#    Feature in Code: `feature_list["start_cycle"]`

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" (power control).
# 2. Set `variable_wash_mode` to "Wash, Sterilize, Dry" (choose wash mode).
# 3. Set `variable_start_running` to "on" (start cycle).
