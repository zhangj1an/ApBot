Feedback Variable: 

 variable_start_running: on 


Comparison result: 

 Let's compare the goal state and the given feedback:

**Goal State:**  
`variable_start_running: on`

**Feedback:**  
`variable_start_running: on`

Comparison:  
The variable name `variable_start_running` matches in both the goal state and feedback. The value `on` in the feedback also matches exactly with the goal state value `on`. Therefore, according to Rule 1, the pair matches.

**Reasoning:**  
reason = "The variable name and value match exactly between the goal state and the feedback. The value 'on' fulfills the goal state requirement."  
goal_reached = True 


Execution failed on attempt 1: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 reason = "The feedback shows 'variable_start_running' is 'on', which matches the goal state where 'variable_start_running' is also set to 'on'. According to Rule 1, the values are the same."
