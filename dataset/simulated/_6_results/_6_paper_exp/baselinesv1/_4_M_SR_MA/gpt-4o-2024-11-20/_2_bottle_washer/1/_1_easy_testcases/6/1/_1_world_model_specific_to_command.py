# The initial code correctly models features relevant to the user command: "Power on the appliance and set it to dry-only mode for 45 minutes."
# - The feature "activate_sterilizer" models powering on the appliance.
# - The feature "dryer_only_time" models setting the drying time to 45 minutes, and the variable "variable_dryer_only_time" is appropriately defined.
