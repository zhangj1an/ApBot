# The given user command is to turn on the washer, select a plastic bottle that was refrigerated (4℃), and set its volume to 4-6 fl-oz. After selecting these, the appliance should start warming. 

# Check whether the existing code can fulfill the requirements:

# The relevant user manual text:
# - **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off.
# - | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#   |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#   | Milk bag      | Room- 25℃ (77℉)           | 1-3 fl- oz    |
#   | Plastic       | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2℉)        | 4-6 fl- oz    |
#   | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl- oz     |
# - **Sterilization:** Choose "Plastic 0 F 7+ oz" for the 15-minute sterilizer function.

# The current code has the following features:
# - "power_and_start_warming" toggles power on/off and starts warming.
# - "select_bottle_type" allows the selection of the bottle type.
# - "select_initial_temperature" allows the selection of the initial temperature.
# - "select_volume" allows the selection of the warming volume.

# Verification:
# - The feature "power_and_start_warming" models the turning on/off functionality, which is correct.
# - The features "select_bottle_type", "select_initial_temperature", and "select_volume" separately model the selection of bottle type, temperature, and volume, aligning with the user manual.
# - The variable `variable_start_running` ensures the appliance starts warming as described.

# Therefore, the provided code already satisfies the user's command.

# Steps required to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use the "power_and_start_warming" feature to turn on the appliance.
# 2. Use the "select_bottle_type" feature to select "Plastic".
# 3. Use the "select_initial_temperature" feature to select "Refrig".
# 4. Use the "select_volume" feature to select "4-6 fl-oz".
# 5. Finally, ensure that the appliance starts warming.
