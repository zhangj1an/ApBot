# Python comments on accuracy check:
# The given code accurately models the user manual's features for turning on the rice cooker, setting it to cook jasmine rice, adjusting the preset time to a total of 4 hours, and starting the machine.
# 
# Relevant Features:
# 1. Start Appliance:
#    - User manual states: "Press Start to turn on the appliance."
#    - Feature: `start_appliance`
# 2. Select Cooking Program:
#    - User manual states: "Press the designated button of the cooking mode, e.g., Jasmine Rice."
#    - Feature: `select_cooking_program`
# 3. Adjust Preset Time:
#    - User manual states: "Press Preset to adjust the preset time."
#    - Feature: `adjust_preset_time`
# 4. Start the machine:
#    - User manual implies the machine starts after pressing Start again.
#    - Feature: `start_appliance` (double-check using `variable_start_running` which tracks "on/off" state).

# Sequence of Features to Achieve Command:
# Step 1: Use `start_appliance` to turn on the appliance: Press the start button, setting `variable_start_running` to "on."
# Step 2: Use `select_cooking_program` to select "jasmine rice."
# Step 3: Use `adjust_preset_time` to set the preset time to 240 minutes (4 hours).
# Step 4: Use `start_appliance` again to begin cooking.

# Goal Variable Values to Achieve Command:
# 1. Set `variable_start_running` to "on" (turn on the appliance and start cooking).
# 2. Set `variable_cooking_program` to "jasmine_rice."
# 3. Set `variable_preset_time` to 240 (4 hours in minutes).

# As the given Simulator already supports all these functionalities, no extension is required.
