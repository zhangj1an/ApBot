# Analyze and verify the existing code for the user command:
# The task requires setting the rice cooker to slow cook stew mode for 3 hours (180 minutes) using the variable_timer, then starting the appliance.

# Verification against the user manual and current feature list:
# 1. **Selecting "slow cook/stew"**: This is correctly modeled in the feature `select_cooking_program` and uses variable_cooking_program.
# 2. **Setting the timer to 3 hours (180 minutes)**: This is modeled in the feature `adjust_timer` using the variable_timer.
# 3. **Starting the machine**: This is correctly modeled in the feature `start_appliance` and uses variable_start_running.

# All task requirements are fully aligned with and supported by the given code. No variables or features are missing.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# - Feature: "select_cooking_program" to set variable_cooking_program to "slow_cook_stew".
# - Feature: "adjust_timer" to set variable_timer to "180" (minutes).
# - Feature: "start_appliance" to set variable_start_running to "on".

# Relevant user manual excerpts:
# - **Cooking Programs**: "You can press the button of the program you want to choose directly..."
# - **Timer Adjustment**: "For these programs, you can adjust the cooking time. Press 'Timer'..."
# - **Start Appliance**: "Press 'Start' button to begin the operation."

# Corresponding feature_list references in given code:
# - Feature `select_cooking_program`
# - Feature `adjust_timer`
# - Feature `start_appliance`

# Generate the goal variable values:
# - `variable_cooking_program`: "slow_cook_stew"
# - `variable_timer`: 180
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
