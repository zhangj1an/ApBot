# Python comments:
# The provided code correctly models the features of the appliance based on the user manual.
# The sequence of steps needed to achieve the user command "Turn on the rice cooker and set to congee mode with a variable_timer set for 1.5 hours. Then start the machine." can be carried out directly with the given features and actions.
# Below are the steps and the relevant features:
# 
# Step 1: Turn on the machine - Use the feature "start_appliance" to set variable_start_running to "on".
# Step 2: Set to congee mode - Use the feature "select_cooking_program" to set variable_cooking_program to "soup_congee".
# Step 3: Set the timer to 1.5 hours - Use the feature "adjust_timer" to set variable_timer value to 90 minutes (1.5 hours).
# Step 4: Start the machine - This has already been done in Step 1 since "start_appliance" equates to starting the machine.
#
# User Manual References:
# - "Press 'Soup/Congee' button to select the Soup/Congee program" (setting congee mode).
# - "Under each program, you can use the timer button to adjust the timer value".
# - "Press the start button to turn on the machine and begin operation".
# Feature list reflecting the above:
# 1. "start_appliance"
# 2. "select_cooking_program"
# 3. "adjust_timer"
#
# The goal variable values to achieve the user command are:
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
# - Set variable_cooking_program to "soup_congee".
# - Set variable_timer to 90 (minutes).
