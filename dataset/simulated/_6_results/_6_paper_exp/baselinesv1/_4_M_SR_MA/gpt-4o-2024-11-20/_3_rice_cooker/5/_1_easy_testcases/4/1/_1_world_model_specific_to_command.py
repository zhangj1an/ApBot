# The given code is accurate. Below is the pattern for the given user command:
# 
# **Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:**
# 1. Start the appliance: feature_list["start_appliance"]
#    - User presses the start button to turn on the appliance. 
#    - This will set `variable_start_running` to "on".
# 
# 2. Select the cooking program: feature_list["select_cooking_program"]
#    - User selects "soup_congee" cooking program to cook congee.
#    - This will set `variable_cooking_program` to "soup_congee".
# 
# 3. Adjust the timer: feature_list["adjust_timer"]
#    - Set the timer to 2 hours (120 minutes).
#    - This will set `variable_timer` to "120".
# 
# 4. Start the appliance: feature_list["start_appliance"]
#    - This feature ensures the appliance starts running for the selected program and timer.
#    - Restarts with `variable_start_running` set to "on".
# 
# **User Manual Text:**
# - "Press 'start' to begin operation of the appliance." (Referencing `feature_list["start_appliance"]`).
# - "Select the desired cooking program. (e.g., soup/congee)." (Referencing `feature_list["select_cooking_program"]`).
# - "Use the timer button to adjust the desired cooking time before starting." (Referencing `feature_list["adjust_timer"]`).
# - "Press 'start' again to engage the selected values and begin the process." (Referencing `feature_list["start_appliance"]`).
# 
# **Goal Variable Values:**
# - `variable_start_running: "on"`
# - `variable_cooking_program: "soup_congee"`
# - `variable_timer: 120`
#
# The code correctly models these steps and no changes are required.
