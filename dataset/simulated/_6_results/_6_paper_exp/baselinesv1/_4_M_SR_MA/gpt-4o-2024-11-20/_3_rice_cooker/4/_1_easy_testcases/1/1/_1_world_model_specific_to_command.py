# The current code accurately models the required features: "set_menu" for selecting the function, "set_delay_time" for setting the reservation timer, and "start_cooking" for starting the machine.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the feature "set_menu" to select the 'WHITE RICE' function.
# 2. Use the feature "set_delay_time" to set the reservation timer to 4 hours.
# 3. Use the feature "start_cooking" to start the machine.

# Relevant user manual text:
# - "WHITE RICE" function: "...select Quick Rice or other functions by using the Quick Rice or MENU button."
# - "Set the timer for cooking completion: Press the “DELAY” button, ... then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
# - "Start cooking: Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# Corresponding feature_list names and steps:
# - "set_menu" to select 'WHITE RICE' (step 1: press "press_menu_button" to adjust menu index to 'white_rice').
# - "set_delay_time" to set the reservation time to 4 hours (step 1: press "press_delay_button").
# - "start_cooking" to start the machine (step 1: press "press_start_button").

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "white_rice".
# - Set `variable_delay_time` to 4.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
