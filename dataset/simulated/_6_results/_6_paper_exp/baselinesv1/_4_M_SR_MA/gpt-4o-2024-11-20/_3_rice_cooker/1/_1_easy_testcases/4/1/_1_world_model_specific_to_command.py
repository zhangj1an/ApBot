# Python comments: The current code correctly models the necessary features and actions to achieve the user command "Prepare glutinous rice. Set the preset timer to 3 hours, then start."

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is:
# 1. "set_cooking_mode" — To select the "Glutinous rice" cooking mode.
# 2. "set_preset_time" — To set the preset timer to 3 hours.
# 3. "start_appliance" — To start the appliance.

# Relevant user manual text for each feature:
# - "Set the menu to Glutinous rice function — select the desired function by pressing the 'Menu' button." (Source: User manual, Menu button section).
# - "You can preset the delayed cooking time using the Preset timer button; available from 1 hour up to 24 hours." (Source: User manual, Preset timer section).
# - "Press the 'Start' button to start cooking." (Source: User manual, Start button section).

# The corresponding feature_list in the provided code:
# - Feature: "set_cooking_mode" — Correctly models the action to press the menu button and select the desired cooking mode.
# - Feature: "set_preset_time" — Correctly models the steps to press the preset timer button, then set hours and minutes using the HR and MIN buttons.
# - Feature: "start_appliance" — Correctly models the action to press the start button and transition the variable_start_running to "on".

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_cooking_mode to "Glutinous rice".
# - Set variable_preset_time_hr to "3".
# - Set variable_preset_time_min to "0".
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
