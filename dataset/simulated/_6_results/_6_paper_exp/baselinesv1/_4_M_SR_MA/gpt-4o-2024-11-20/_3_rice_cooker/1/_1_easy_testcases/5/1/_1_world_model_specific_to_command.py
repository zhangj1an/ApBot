# Python comments explaining the given code and its suitability for the user command:

# The given code accurately models the user command "Make soup with the rice cooker. Set the preset timer to 4 hours, then start."
# Explanation:
# Relevant features and actions in the provided code:
# 1. The "set_cooking_mode" feature allows selecting the "Soup" menu option using the "press_menu_button" action.
#    - The relevant feature from the code: "set_cooking_mode".
# 2. The "set_preset_time" feature models setting preset time to 4 hours.
#    - The action "press_preset_timer_button" initiates preset time settings.
#    - Subsequent actions "press_hr_button" and "press_min_button" adjust the hours and minutes respectively.
#    - The relevant feature from the code: "set_preset_time".
# 3. The "start_appliance" feature is triggered by the "press_start_button" action to start the appliance.
#    - The relevant feature from the code: "start_appliance".
#
# Therefore, the feature list and actions in the code are sufficient to fulfill the user command.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# 1. Set `variable_cooking_mode` to "Soup".
# 2. Set `variable_preset_time_hr` to 4.
# 3. Set `variable_preset_time_min` to 0.
# 4. Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
