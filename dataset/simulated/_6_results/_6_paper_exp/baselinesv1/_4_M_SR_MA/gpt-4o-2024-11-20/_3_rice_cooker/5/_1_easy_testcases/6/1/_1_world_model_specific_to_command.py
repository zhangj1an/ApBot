# Python Comments on Assessment of Current Code Implementation
# The current code correctly models the appliance's relevant features for the user's command:
# 1. Set preset time to 7 hours.
# 2. Select the jasmine rice cooking program.
# 3. Start the appliance.

# Relevant Features:
# - Preset time adjustment (`adjust_preset_time`): Fully modeled to adjust `variable_preset_time` in the user manual. 
#   User manual excerpt: "When the cooking program is chosen..., press the 'Preset' button to set the time for finishing cooking."
# - Cooking program selection (`select_cooking_program`): Modes like "jasmine_rice" are modeled via `variable_cooking_program`.
#   User manual excerpt: "Press the button of the program you want to choose directly, and the light of the selected program will be on."
# - Appliance start (`start_appliance`): They accurately set `variable_start_running` to "on."
#   User manual excerpt: "Press 'Start' button to start cooking."

# Sequence of Features to Achieve User Command
# 1. Adjust the preset time to 7 hours (420 minutes): Use `adjust_preset_time` with `variable_preset_time`.
# 2. Select the jasmine rice cooking program: Use `select_cooking_program` and set `variable_cooking_program` to "jasmine_rice."
# 3. Start the appliance: Execute `start_appliance` and set `variable_start_running` to "on."

# Goal Variable Values
# - `variable_preset_time`: 420 (minutes for 7 hours).
# - `variable_cooking_program`: "jasmine_rice".
# - `variable_start_running`: "on".
