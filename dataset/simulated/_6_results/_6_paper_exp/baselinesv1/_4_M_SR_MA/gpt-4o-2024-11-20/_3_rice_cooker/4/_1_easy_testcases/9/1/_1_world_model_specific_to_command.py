# Python comment:
# Upon reviewing the user manual and the given model, it appears everything is accurately modeled regarding the requested user command. The required steps are as follows:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the "set_menu" feature to set the menu to "white_rice"
# 2. Use the "set_delay_time" feature to set the delayed start time to 6 hours.
# 3. Use the "start_cooking" feature to start the machine.

# Raw user manual text describing the relevant features:
# 1. "After closing the lid, select Quick Rice or other functions by using the Quick Rice or MENU button."
# 2. "Set the timer for cooking completion. Press the “DELAY” button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
# 3. "Start cooking. Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# Relevant feature_list names in the given code:
# - "set_menu"
# - "set_delay_time"
# - "start_cooking"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "white_rice"
# - Set `variable_delay_time` to 6
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on"
