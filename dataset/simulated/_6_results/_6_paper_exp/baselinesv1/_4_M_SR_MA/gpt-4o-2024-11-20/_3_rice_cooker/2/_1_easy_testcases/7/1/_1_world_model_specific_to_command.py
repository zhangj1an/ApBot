# Python comments explaining the current situation with respect to the user command:

# 1. The code has successfully modeled the relevant appliance variables:
#    - `variable_cooking_mode` for selecting modes such as "fast cook," "white rice," "congee," etc.
#    - `variable_preset_timer` for setting the timer in 15-minute increments up to 24 hours.
#    - `variable_start_running` for starting the machine with "on" and "off" states.

# 2. The code correctly models three features:
#    - Feature "select_cooking_mode": Allows the user to choose the desired cooking mode.
#    - Feature "adjust_preset_timer": Enables adjustments to the preset timer.
#    - Feature "start_cooking": Ensures the machine starts its process.

# 3. The user command explicitly requires the following sequence of actions:
#    - Set the mode to "congee."
#    - Set the timer to "5 hours" (300 minutes).
#    - Start the machine.

# 4. These tasks can be achieved using the current features:
#    - "select_cooking_mode" allows switching to the "congee" mode.
#    - "adjust_preset_timer" allows setting the timer to 5 hours.
#    - "start_cooking" can activate the machine. 

# 5. The user manual supports this implementation as per:
"""
- "Press Menu/Cancel to choose Fast Cook, White Rice, Congee, Soup, Cake, Keep warm. The indicator of chosen function blinks."
- "Press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer. The preset timer should be longer than cooking time. The preset time is up to 24 hours."
- "Press Start to confirm. The rice cooker starts working at the selected mode."
"""

# 6. The feature_list names in the given code are:
#    - "select_cooking_mode"
#    - "adjust_preset_timer"
#    - "start_cooking"

# Given the current implementation, the actions required to accomplish the user command are compatible with the defined features and variables.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - Set `variable_cooking_mode` to "congee."
# - Set `variable_preset_timer` to the value of 300 (representing 5 hours).
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on" to start the machine.

# The current implementation is accurate, and no modifications are necessary to achieve the user's request. Therefore, we will simply extend the Simulator class as follows.
