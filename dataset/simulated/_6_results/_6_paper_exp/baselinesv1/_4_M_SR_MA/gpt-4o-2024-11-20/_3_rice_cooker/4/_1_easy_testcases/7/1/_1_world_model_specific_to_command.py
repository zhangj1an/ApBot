# The current code correctly models the relevant feature required to achieve the user command.
# The sequence of features required to execute the command is as follows:
# 1. Use "feature_list['set_menu']" to choose the "SOUP" menu.
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press the “MENU” button to select the “SOUP” function."
# 2. Use "feature_list['set_delay_time']" to set the delay start time to "3 hours."
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press the “DELAY” button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
# 3. Use "feature_list['start_cooking']" to start the machine.
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# The goal variable values are:
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "soup" to choose the "SOUP" program.
# - Set `variable_delay_time` to "3" to delay the start by 3 hours.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on" to start the machine.
