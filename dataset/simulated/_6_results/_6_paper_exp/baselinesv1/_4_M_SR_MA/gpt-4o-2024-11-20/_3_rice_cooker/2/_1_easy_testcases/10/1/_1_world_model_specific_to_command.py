# The given code is mostly accurate in addressing the user's command: 
# "Set the mode to white rice for dinner in four hours, and start the machine." 
# However, there are some missing features and variables which need to be addressed. 

# The overlooked issue involves the functionality of setting the preset timer for delayed cooking, as specified in the user manual. 
# The user manual describes using the "preset/timer" button to set the time for delayed cooking and explicitly states: 
# "2. Press Preset/Timer to adjust the time. ↳ With each press, the time increases by 15 minutes. 
# Long press Preset/Timer to quickly adjust the time... If you want to enjoy delicious rice after 8 hours, set the preset time to 8 hours."

# Additionally, the action to start the machine ("press_start_button") is modeled correctly in the existing code.

# Updates Required:
# 1. Adjust the feature and action to ensure appropriate behavior for setting "variable_preset_timer."
#    While the current implementation models "adjust_preset_timer" setup properly, 
#    we need to confirm the timer accurately reflects the raw user manual text to allow users to delay cooking effectively.
# 2. Include and update sequences to meet the user command requirements adequately.

# Steps to achieve the command:
# Feature order: "select_cooking_mode" → "adjust_preset_timer" → "start_cooking."
# Goal variable values:
# variable_cooking_mode: "white rice"
# variable_preset_timer: "240" (4 hours, represented as minutes in the timer)
# variable_start_running: "on"

# Below, we return an ExtendedSimulator class to verify all requirements and ensure consistency.
