# The current code accurately models the necessary appliance features to achieve the user command:
# Schedule 'STEAM' function to finish in 5 hours, then start the machine.
# Below is the reasoning:

# **Sequence of Features Needed to Achieve the Command:**
# 1. **Set Menu to STEAM**:
#    - Use the feature `set_menu` to adjust `variable_menu_index` to `"steam"`.
#    - User manual reference: "**Steaming**: Put the food in the steamer, then put the steamer into the inner pot, close the lid, press the MENU button and select STEAM..."
#
# 2. **Set Delay Time to Finish in 5 Hours**:
#    - Use the feature `set_delay_time` to adjust `variable_delay_time`. 
#    - User manual reference: "**Reservation**: Press the 'DELAY' button, and then press it again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
#
# 3. **Start Cooking**:
#    - Use the feature `start_cooking` to set `variable_start_running` to `"on"`.
#    - User manual reference: "**Start cooking**: Press the 'START' button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# The following variable values need to be targeted to achieve the user command:
# - `variable_menu_index` = "steam"
# - `variable_delay_time` = 5
# - `variable_start_running` = "on"
