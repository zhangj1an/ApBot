#    - Related feature_list name: "power_control"
#    - Goal variable value: Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
#
# 2. Use the feature "adjust_fan_speed_mode" to set the fan speed to Level 2.
#    - Raw User Manual: "Fan Speed/Mode Button: Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo and Auto mode, and Sleep mode."
#    - Related feature_list name: "adjust_fan_speed_mode"
