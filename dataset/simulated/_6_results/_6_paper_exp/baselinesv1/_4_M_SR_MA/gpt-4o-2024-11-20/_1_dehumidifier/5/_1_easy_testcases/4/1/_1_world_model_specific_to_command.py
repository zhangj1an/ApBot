# The user command is to power on the dehumidifier and activate the sleep mode. 
# The given code already accurately models the required functionality as follows:

# 1. To power on the dehumidifier: 
# Relevant feature: "power_control"
# Raw user manual text: "Power Button (ON/OFF): Turns the unit on and off."
# Feature list name in given code: "feature_list['power_control']"
# Action: "press_power_button"
# Variable: "variable_power_on_off" (set to "on")

# 2. To activate the sleep mode:
# Relevant feature: "enable_sleep_mode"
# Raw user manual text: "Sleep (SLEEP): Press to send the display to sleep. The unit will continue working on the low fan mode but the lights will turn off."
# Feature list name in given code: "feature_list['enable_sleep_mode']"
# Action: "press_sleep_button"
# Variable: "variable_sleep_mode" (set to "on")

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_sleep_mode = "on"
