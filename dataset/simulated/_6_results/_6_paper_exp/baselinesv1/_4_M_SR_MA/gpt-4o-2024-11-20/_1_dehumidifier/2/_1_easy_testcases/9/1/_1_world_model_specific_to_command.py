# The current code already correctly models the features and variables required to execute the user command "Switch on the dehumidifier and adjust the fan speed to AUTO." 

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Use "power_on_off" feature to turn the dehumidifier on. This corresponds to pressing the power button and toggling the variable_power_on_off between "on" and "off".
# 2. Use "set_fan_speed" feature to adjust the fan speed. This corresponds to pressing the fan speed button and cycling through fan speed options until it is set to "AUTO".

# Relevant raw user manual text:
# - "Press the ⏻ button to turn on/off the unit." — This is modeled as feature_list["power_on_off"].
# - "Press the 🔄 button consecutively to select the preferred fan speed (High, Medium, Low, or Auto) by pressing the 🔄 button." — This is modeled as feature_list["set_fan_speed"].

# Relevant feature names in the provided code:
# - feature_list["power_on_off"]
# - feature_list["set_fan_speed"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_fan_speed = "AUTO"
