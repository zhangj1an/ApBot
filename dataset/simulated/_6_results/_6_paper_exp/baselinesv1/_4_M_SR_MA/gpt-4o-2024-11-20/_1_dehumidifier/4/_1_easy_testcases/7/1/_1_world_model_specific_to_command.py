# User command: Turn on the dehumidifier and select 'microbe_shield' to eliminate mold and bacteria in the room.

# Python comment: 
# The provided code accurately models the relevant appliance features as per the user manual. 
# Specifically:
# 1. The "power_on_off" feature models turning on/off the appliance using the power button. This aligns with the following user manual text:
#    "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# 2. The "microbe_shield_night_mode" feature models cycling through "Microbe Shield," "Night Mode," and "Off" using the Microbe Shield™/Night Mode button. This aligns with:
#    "The Microbe Shield™ and Night Modes utilize the same button on the control panel. Pressing the (microbe shield) Microbe Shield™/NIGHT MODE button will cycle through these two settings."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# - "power_on_off" to turn on the dehumidifier.
# - "microbe_shield_night_mode" to select 'microbe_shield'.

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_microbe_shield_night_mode` to "microbe_shield".

# Existing feature_list and actions already model these functionalities correctly. No modifications are required.
