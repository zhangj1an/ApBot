# The given code already includes the necessary features to achieve the user command to power on the device 
# and set the fan speed to "turbo". Here is the reasoning:
# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "power_on_off" feature to turn the air purifier on.
# 2. "adjust_fan_speed" feature to set the fan speed to "turbo".

# Relevant user manual texts:
# - For powering on: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# - For fan speed adjustment: "Press the (fan speed) FAN SPEED button repeatedly until the desired speed is illuminated on the control panel. There are 4 fan speeds: Low, Medium, High and Turbo."

# Relevant feature list names:
# - "power_on_off"
# - "adjust_fan_speed"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - `variable_power_on_off` should be set to "on".
# - `variable_fan_speed` should be set to "turbo".
