Attempt to generate world model: 0
The appliance does not have any number pads, so the simulator should not have methods like 'press_number_button', 'get_original_input', 'process_input_string', or variables like 'meta_actions_dict' and 'variable_input_string'. Please remove these methods and variables from the generated code.
