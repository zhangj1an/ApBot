# The command is to engage the dehumidifier and set the timer to '8H'. As per the user manual text and given code:
# 
# **Engage the dehumidifier:** This corresponds to turning the power on. 
# **Set timer to '8H':** This corresponds to setting the timer for the appliance to operate overnight.
# 
# 1. The features modeled, "power_on_off" and "set_timer", align with the user manual requirements.
# 2. The feature "power_on_off" is triggered by pressing the `press_power_button` as per the user manual and code.
#    User manual text: *Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate.*
#    Corresponding feature: `feature_list["power_on_off"]`.
# 
# 3. The feature "set_timer" allows cycling through timer options including '8H'.
#    User manual text: *Press the ‚è≤ TIMER button repeatedly until the desired interval hours are illuminated on the control panel.*
#    Corresponding feature: `feature_list["set_timer"]`.
# 
# Features required to achieve the command sequence:
# - Feature `power_on_off` to turn on the dehumidifier (set `variable_power_on_off` to "on").
# - Feature `set_timer` to set the timer to '8H' (set `variable_timer` to "8H").
# 
# The current implementation correctly represents these actions and features. 

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on" (to engage the dehumidifier).
# - `variable_timer`: "8H" (to set the timer for overnight operation).
