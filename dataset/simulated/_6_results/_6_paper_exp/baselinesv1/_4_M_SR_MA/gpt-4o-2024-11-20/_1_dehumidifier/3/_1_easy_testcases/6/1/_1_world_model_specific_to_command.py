# The current code is accurate to achieve the command. Below is the reasoning:

# Sequence of features needed:
# 1. Feature: power_control - Turn on the appliance. ("press_power_button")
#    Relevant raw text from the user manual: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."
#    Feature name in the code: power_control
# 2. Feature: adjust_fan_speed_mode - Set the fan to "Sleep" mode for quieter operation. ("press_speed_mode_button")
#    Relevant raw text from the user manual: 
#    - "Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo and Auto mode, and Sleep mode."
#    Feature name in the code: adjust_fan_speed_mode

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_fan_speed_mode to "Sleep".
