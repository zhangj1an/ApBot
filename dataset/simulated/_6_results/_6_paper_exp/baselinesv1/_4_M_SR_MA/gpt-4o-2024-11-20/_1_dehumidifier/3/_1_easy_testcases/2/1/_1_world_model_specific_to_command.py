# The simulator code provided is already accurate and models the relevant appliance features described in the user manual. 
# All variables and feature steps required to achieve the user command "Switch on the dehumidifier and ensure the fan is at speed level 1 for gentle operation" are modeled correctly.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Feature: "power_control" (Turn the appliance power on).
#    - User manual text: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."
#    - Feature list name: "power_control".
# 2. Feature: "adjust_fan_speed_mode" (Ensure fan is at speed level 1).
#    - User manual text: "Fan Speed/Mode Button: Press the Speed/Mode button to cycle between fan speeds 1, 2, 3, Turbo and Auto mode, and Sleep mode."
#    - Feature list name: "adjust_fan_speed_mode".

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_fan_speed_mode` to "1".
