# The given code is accurate in modeling the features and variables needed to achieve the command requested.
# Below is the step-by-step breakdown of the feature sequence needed to achieve the command:

# Sequence of features:
# 1. "power_on_off" - Switch on the dehumidifier by pressing the power button.
# 2. "mode_selection" - Use the mode selection button to activate continuous dehumidification mode.

# Raw User Manual Text:
# - "POWER: start or shut down the dehumidifier."
# - "MODE: select auto dehumidification, Continuous dehumidification, Drying clothes, purification and ventilation, etc."

# Relevant feature_list from the given code:
# 1. feature_list["power_on_off"]
# 2. feature_list["mode_selection"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_mode_selection` to "continuous_dehumidification".
