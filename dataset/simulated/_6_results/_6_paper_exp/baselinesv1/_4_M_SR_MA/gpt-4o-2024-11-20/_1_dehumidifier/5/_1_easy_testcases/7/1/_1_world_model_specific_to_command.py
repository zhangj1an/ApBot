# Check the given code for correctness against the user command: "Power on the dehumidifier and set the fan speed to 'low.'"
# The features required are:
# 1. Turning on/off the power: Modelled as feature_list["power_control"].
# 2. Adjusting the fan speed: Modelled as feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"].

# These features are correctly defined in the given code. 
# Relevant user manual text: 
# 1) "Power Button (ON/OFF): Turns the unit on and off."
# 2) "Fan/Air Speed (SPEED): 1. Low 2. Mid 3. High."
# The features correctly encapsulate the necessary actions to achieve the command:
# - Feature "power_control" toggles the power state using the "press_power_button".
# - Feature "adjust_fan_speed" adjusts the fan speed using the "press_speed_button".
# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# 1) Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# 2) Set variable_fan_speed to "1".
