# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance features for the user command to turn on the dehumidifier and set it to purification mode.
# Below is the analysis of the user manual and the feature_list provided in the given code.

# User Manual Relevant Sections:
# 1. POWER: start or shut down the dehumidifier.
# 2. MODE: select auto dehumidification, Continuous dehumidification, Drying clothes, purification, and ventilation.

# Feature list in the given code:
# - `feature_list["power_on_off"]`: {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"} matches turning the dehumidifier on/off.
# - `feature_list["mode_selection"]`: {
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_mode_button"], "variable": "variable_mode_selection"},
#     {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_and_hold_mode_button"], "variable": "variable_child_lock"}
#   } matches selecting the purification mode.

# Features Needed to Achieve the Command:
# - "power_on_off" to turn on the dehumidifier. 
# - "mode_selection" to set it to the mode "purification".

# Goal Variable Values:
# - `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - `variable_mode_selection` to "purification".

# The current implementation correctly implements the relevant features and variables.
