# User command: Activate the dehumidifier and set the timer to 8 hours for extended operation.

# According to the user manual, activating the dehumidifier corresponds to turning the air purifier on 
# and setting the timer to 8 hours corresponds to the timer feature. The current code correctly models these steps 
# based on the following raw texts from the user manual:

# Raw text: "Power Button: Turn air purifier on and off."
# Feature from the code: feature_list["power_control"]

# Raw text: "Timer Button: Time can be selected from 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours."
# Feature from the code: feature_list["adjust_timer"]

# Sequence of features required to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the "power_control" feature to turn the air purifier power on.
# 2. Use the "adjust_timer" feature to set the timer to "8H".

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_timer` to "8H".
