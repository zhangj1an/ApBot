# Python comments regarding feature validation for the user command:
# The code correctly models the relevant appliance features associated with the user command:
# 1. "Turn on the dehumidifier" corresponds to the "power_on_off" feature.
#    - Relevant raw user manual text: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
#    - Relevant feature: "power_on_off".
#
# 2. "Set the fan speed to 'low' for a quiet operation while you're working" corresponds to the "adjust_fan_speed" feature.
#    - Relevant raw user manual text: "Press the (fan speed) FAN SPEED button repeatedly until the desired speed is illuminated on the control panel. There are 4 fan speeds: Low, Medium, High and Turbo."
#    - Relevant feature: "adjust_fan_speed".
#
# The features in the provided code are sufficient to achieve the user command.

# Required sequence of features:
# - First, use the "power_on_off" feature to turn on the appliance.
# - Next, use the "adjust_fan_speed" feature to set the fan speed to "low".

# Goal variable values for the user command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_fan_speed` to "low".
