# The provided code sufficiently models the relevant appliance features to achieve the user command.
# After analyzing the user manual and comparing it with the code, the features and actions required to:
# 1) Turn on the dehumidifier and 2) Start the air swing are already included.
#
# Sequence of features needed:
# 1. "power_on_off" to switch on the dehumidifier.
#    - User manual: "Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation."
#    - Feature name in the code: "power_on_off"
#    - Variable: "variable_power_on_off"
# 2. "adjust_air_swing" to start the air swing.
#    - User manual: "SWING: start air swing function to realize wide-angle air sweeping."
#    - Feature name in the code: "adjust_air_swing"
#    - Variable: "variable_air_swing"
#
# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_air_swing` to "on".

# Since no new features or action modifications are required, we just create an ExtendedSimulator class.
