# The current code correctly models the two relevant features:
# - Turn the dehumidifier on is modeled as the "power_on_off" feature.
# - Set the humidity level to 50% is modeled as the "adjust_humidity" feature.

# The sequence of actions corresponds to the following feature steps:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature:
#      - Step 1: Press "press_power_button" to set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Use the "adjust_humidity" feature:
#      - Step 1: Press "press_humidity_button" repeatedly to adjust `variable_humidity_level` to 50%.

# User manual excerpts:
# - **POWER**: Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation.
# - **HUMIDITY**: Humidity can be set in Auto mode, wind speed can be adjusted in air purification mode and wind mode.

# Given code features:
# - `feature_list["power_on_off"]` correctly models turning the dehumidifier on/off.
# - `feature_list["adjust_humidity"]` correctly models adjusting humidity level.

# Goal variable values for this command:
# - `variable_power_on_off` should be set to "on".
# - `variable_humidity_level` should be set to 50%.
