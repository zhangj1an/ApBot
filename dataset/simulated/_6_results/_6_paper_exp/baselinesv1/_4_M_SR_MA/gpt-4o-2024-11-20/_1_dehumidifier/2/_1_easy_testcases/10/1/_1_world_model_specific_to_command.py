# Based on the user command, here is what we need to verify:
# The given code requires the dehumidifier to be turned on (which means toggling variable_power_on_off to "on").
# Then, it sets the programmable timer to 12 hours (adjusting variable_timer_setting to 12).
# All the related variables and features are properly modeled in the given Simulator class.

# Relevant features and variables:
# - Feature: "power_on_off" represented as {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_on_off_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}
# - Feature: "set_timer" represented as {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_timer_button"], "variable": "variable_timer_setting"}
# Variable: variable_power_on_off controls the power state of the appliance.
# Variable: variable_timer_setting is a continuous variable representing the timer setting.

# Raw user manual text:
# 1. Power On/Off: "Press the ‚èª button to turn on/off the unit."
# 2. Programmable Timer: "Unit is equipped with a programmable timer for an automatically turn on or turn off."
#    "Press the timer button on the control panel and the timer indicator and the timer hours start to flash on the display screen."
#    "Press the timer button again consecutively to select your preferred timer duration from 1 to 24 hours at an interval of 1 hour for an automatic turn on."
#
# Given feature_list from the initial code correctly models this behavior:
# - Feature: "power_on_off" allows toggling the power state using "press_on_off_button".
# - Feature: "set_timer" allows setting the timer via "press_timer_button", adjustable from 1 to 24 hours.

# Goal feature sequence:
# 1. "power_on_off" to activate the appliance by turning it "on".
# 2. "set_timer" to set the timer to 12 hours.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. variable_power_on_off should be set to "on".
# 2. variable_timer_setting should be set to 12.
