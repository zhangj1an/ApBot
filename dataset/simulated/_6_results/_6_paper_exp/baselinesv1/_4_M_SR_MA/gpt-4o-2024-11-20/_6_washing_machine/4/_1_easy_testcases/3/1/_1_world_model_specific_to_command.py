# The user command: "Power up the washing machine and use the Fragrance program for 15 minutes at the lowest water level, 
# spin 3 minutes, and set rinse to 'Water-Injection Rinse 1 time', then start the machine running." 
# This command can directly be achieved by correctly sequenced utilization of the existing appliance features in the given code.

# **Relevant Features and Variables:**
# 1. To power up the washing machine → feature_list["power_on_off"], variable_power_on_off.
#    User manual ref: "Press this button to switch power on and off."
# 2. To select the Fragrance program → feature_list["adjust_program"], variable_program.
#    User manual ref: "Changes the program. The program changes each time the button is pressed."
# 3. To set water level → feature_list["adjust_water_level"], variable_water_level.
#    User manual ref: "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."
# 4. To set washing time → feature_list["adjust_wash_time"], variable_washing_time.
#    User manual ref: "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
# 5. To set rinse type → feature_list["adjust_rinse_type"], variable_rinse_type.
#    User manual ref: "Each time you press the Rinse button the setting changes in sequence, from Normal Rinse 2 times, Water-Injection Rinse 2 times, no rinsing, Normal Rinse 1 time, Water-Injection Rinse 1 time."
# 6. To set spin time → feature_list["adjust_spin_time"], variable_spin_time.
#    User manual ref: "You can set the spin time each time you press the Spin button in a range of 1 to 9 minutes and no spinning."
# 7. To start the machine → feature_list["start_pause"], variable_start_running.
#    User manual ref: "Starts and pauses operation."

# **Executing Commands Sequentially Using Features:**
# First, power on (set `variable_power_on_off` to "on").
# Second, set the program to "P4 (Fragrance)".
# Third, adjust the water level to the lowest value of 25 L.
# Fourth, set the washing time to 15 minutes.
# Fifth, set the rinsing type to "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time".
# Sixth, set the spin time to 3 minutes.
# Lastly, start the machine by setting `variable_start_running` to "start".

# **Goal Variable Values:**
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_program`: "P4 (Fragrance)"
# - `variable_water_level`: 25
# - `variable_washing_time`: 15
# - `variable_rinse_type`: "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time"
# - `variable_spin_time`: 3
# - `variable_start_running`: "start"
