# Current code is accurate and correctly models the appliance features relevant to the user command.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Activate the washer (turn it on).
#    Feature: "on_off"
#    User manual text: **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.
#    Code: feature_list["on_off"]
# 
# 2. Configure the program to 'Wool'.
#    Feature: "set_program"
#    User manual text: **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.
#    Code: feature_list["set_program"]
# 
# 3. Set water level to 'High'.
#    Feature: "set_water_level"
#    User manual text: **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.
#    Code: feature_list["set_water_level"]
# 
# 4. Set time manager to 25 minutes.
#    Feature: "set_time_manager"
#    User manual text: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    Code: feature_list["set_time_manager"]
#
# 5. Set rinse times to '2 Times'.
#    Feature: "set_rinse_times"
#    User manual text: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    Code: feature_list["set_rinse_times"]

#    Feature: "set_spin_speed"
#    User manual text: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    Code: feature_list["set_spin_speed"]

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. variable_on_off = "on"
# 2. variable_program = "Wool"
# 3. variable_water_level = "6" (assuming 'High' corresponds to the maximum level, which is "6" based on value range in the code)
# 4. variable_time_manager = "4" (assuming 25 minutes corresponds to setting '4' in the range ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"])
# 5. variable_rinse_times = "2 times"
# 6. variable_spin_speed = "Medium"
