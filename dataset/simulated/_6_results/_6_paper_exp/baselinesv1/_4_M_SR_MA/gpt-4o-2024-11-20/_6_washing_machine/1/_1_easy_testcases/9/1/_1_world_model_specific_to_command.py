# The current code successfully models the required features to achieve the user's command. 
# Below are the sequence of features needed, their associated user manual descriptions, 
# and the feature_list names in the given code.

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. "power_adjust" - Turn the appliance on or off.
#    User manual: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
#    Feature List: feature_list["power_adjust"]
#    Goal Variable Value: variable_power_on_off = "on"

# 2. "adjust_cycle_selector" - Turn the dial to set "Hand Wash" as the cycle.
#    User manual: "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
#    Feature List: feature_list["adjust_cycle_selector"]
#    Goal Variable Value: variable_cycle_selector = "Hand Wash"

# 3. "adjust_temperature" - Set the water temperature to 20°C.
#    User manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options."
#    Feature List: feature_list["adjust_temperature"]
#    Goal Variable Value: variable_temperature = "20°C"

# 4. "adjust_spin_speed" - Set the spin speed to 1200 rpm.
#    User manual: "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    Feature List: feature_list["adjust_spin_speed"]
#    Goal Variable Value: variable_spin_speed = "1200"

# 5. "adjust_options" - Set the washing option to "Soak + Rinse+".
#    User manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options."
#    Feature List: feature_list["adjust_options"]
