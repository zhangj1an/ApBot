# The given code is accurate for the provided user command. Here is how the command can be achieved:

# User Command: Power on the washing machine, set to 'Bedding' setting, 'High' water level, allocate 40 minutes, rinse '3 Times', and spin 'Short'.

# Sequence of features to achieve this command:
# 1. "on_off": Toggle the washing machine power on.
#    - User manual: **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.
#    - feature_list = "on_off"
# 2. "set_program": Set the program to 'Bedding'.
#    - User manual: **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.
#    - feature_list = "set_program"
# 3. "set_water_level": Set the water level to 'High' (value "6").
#    - User manual: **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.
#    - feature_list = "set_water_level"
# 4. "set_time_manager": Allocate to the closest time manager setting, in this case '6'.
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - feature_list = "set_time_manager"
# 5. "set_rinse_times": Set the rinse to '3 Times'.
#    - User manual: Rinsing can be set as per the number of times, selectable with function settings.
#    - feature_list = "set_rinse_times"

#    - User manual: Spinning can be adjusted with function settings based on the load and cycle type.
#    - feature_list = "set_spin_speed"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_on_off = "on"
# variable_program = "Bedding"
# variable_water_level = "6"
# variable_time_manager = "6"  # Closest approximation to 40 minutes
# variable_rinse_times = "3 times"
# variable_spin_speed = "Short"
