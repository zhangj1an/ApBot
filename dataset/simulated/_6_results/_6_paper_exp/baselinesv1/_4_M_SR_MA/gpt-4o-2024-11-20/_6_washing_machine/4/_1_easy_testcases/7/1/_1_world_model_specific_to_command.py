# The requested user command requires accurate modelling of the washing machine's features, as per the given user manual. 
# The provided code correctly models the following relevant variables and features:
# 
# 1. **Turn on the washing machine**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_power_on_off` in `feature_list["power_on_off"]`.
# - User manual text: "Press this button to switch power on and off. The washing machine automatically switches off when operations are finished."
#
# 2. **Select the Small Load program**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_program` in `feature_list["adjust_program"]`.
# - User manual text: "Selects programs. The program changes each time the button is pressed. Example: P9 (Small Load)."
#
# 3. **Set a 25 L water limit**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_water_level` in `feature_list["adjust_water_level"]`.
# - User manual text: "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."
#
# 4. **Set a 9-minute wash cycle**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_washing_time` in `feature_list["adjust_wash_time"]`.
# - User manual text: "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
#
# 5. **Set the rinse type to 'Water-Injection Rinse 2 times'**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_rinse_type` in `feature_list["adjust_rinse_type"]`.
# - User manual text: "Each time you press the Rinse button, the setting changes in sequence, including Water-Injection Rinse 2 times."
#
# 6. **Set a spin duration of 1 minute**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_spin_time` in `feature_list["adjust_spin_time"]`.
# - User manual text: "The spin time can be set between 1 and 9 minutes."
#
# 7. **Start the machine**:
# - This corresponds to the variable `variable_start_running` in `feature_list["start_pause"]`.
# - User manual text: "Starts and pauses operation."
#
# The feature list and variable definitions in the current code are consistent with the described user manual operations, allowing the command to be executed step-by-step without modification.
#
# SEQUENCE OF FEATURES TO ACHIEVE THE COMMAND:
# 1. `feature_list["power_on_off"]`: Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. `feature_list["adjust_program"]`: Set `variable_program` to "P9 (Small Load)".
# 3. `feature_list["adjust_water_level"]`: Set `variable_water_level` to 25.
# 4. `feature_list["adjust_wash_time"]`: Set `variable_washing_time` to 9.
# 5. `feature_list["adjust_rinse_type"]`: Set `variable_rinse_type` to "Water-Injection Rinse 2 times".
# 6. `feature_list["adjust_spin_time"]`: Set `variable_spin_time` to 1.
# 7. `feature_list["start_pause"]`: Set `variable_start_running` to "start".
#
# GOAL VARIABLE VALUES TO ACHIEVE THIS COMMAND:
# - `variable_power_on_off = "on"`
# - `variable_program = "P9 (Small Load)"`
# - `variable_water_level = 25`
# - `variable_washing_time = 9`
# - `variable_rinse_type = "Water-Injection Rinse 2 times"`
# - `variable_spin_time = 1`
# - `variable_start_running = "start"`
