# The existing simulator implementation correctly models the relevant features based on the user manual to achieve the requested user command.

# Following the given user command, the sequence of features needed and the relevant steps to achieve this command are:
# 1. "on_off" feature: Turn the washing appliance on => Set `variable_on_off` to "on".
# 2. "set_program" feature: Choose "Heavy Duty" => Set `variable_program` to "Heavy Duty".
# 3. "set_water_level" feature: Choose 'Mid' water level (assumed to be "3") => Set `variable_water_level` to "3".
# 4. "set_time_manager" feature: Adjust to 50 minutes => Set `variable_time_manager` to "6" (highest value representing maximum time).
# 5. "set_rinse_times" feature: Choose '1 Time' rinse => Set `variable_rinse_times` to "1 time".
# 6. "set_spin_speed" feature: Choose 'Regular' spin speed => Set `variable_spin_speed` to "Medium" (assuming 'Regular' corresponds to Medium).

# Raw user manual text that describes the relevant actions:
# - **1 On/Off button**: Product is switched On or Off.
# - **3 Program buttons**: Available according to the laundry type.
# - **Water Level**: Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling, and washing habits of customers.
# - **Time Manager**: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time, and other settings can be selectable.
# - Rinse Hold: Set rinse times.
# - Spin: Set spin speed.

# Corresponding feature_list keys:
# - "on_off"
# - "set_program"
# - "set_water_level"
# - "set_time_manager"
# - "set_rinse_times"
# - "set_spin_speed"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_on_off = "on"
# variable_program = "Heavy Duty"
# variable_water_level = "3"
# variable_time_manager = "6"
# variable_rinse_times = "1 time"
# variable_spin_speed = "Medium"
