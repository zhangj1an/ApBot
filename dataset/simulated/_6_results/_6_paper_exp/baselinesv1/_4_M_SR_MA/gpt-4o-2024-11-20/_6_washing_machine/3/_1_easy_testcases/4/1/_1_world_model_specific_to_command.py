# User command: Switch the washing machine on, use the Normal program, set the water level to 32 L, and finish in 3 hours. Then start the appliance, then activate the child lock.

# Verification against the user manual:
# 1. The toggle power feature is accurately represented by "feature_list['toggle_power']".
#    User Manual: "Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press 'Start/Pause' within 10 minutes after power-on."
#
# 2. The program selection feature is modeled by "feature_list['select_program']", which correctly adjusts the program.
#    User Manual: "Select a program - Variety of Programs allows selection from Normal, Delicate, Baby-care, etc."
#
# 3. The water level adjustment is represented by "feature_list['adjust_water_level']".
#    User Manual: "Change water level - During the wash process, press 'Water Level' to change the water level."
#
# 4. Timer adjustment (preset) is represented in "feature_list['adjust_preset_timer']".
#    User Manual: "Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours)."
#
# 5. Starting the appliance is modeled by "feature_list['start_operation']", where "variable_start_running" is set to "on".
#    User Manual: "Press Start/Pause."
#
# 6. Activating child lock is modeled by "feature_list['set_child_lock']".
#    User Manual: "Setting Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, if the lid is opened while the washing machine is operating, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed."

# The sequence of features needed: "toggle_power," "select_program," "adjust_water_level," "adjust_preset_timer," "start_operation," and "set_child_lock."

# All the features are correctly modeled in the given code. No additional features or variables need to be added or modified. The goal variable values to achieve the command are as follows:
