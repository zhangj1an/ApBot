# After reviewing the given user manual and the provided code, the relevant features for the user command are correctly modeled, and the actions necessary to achieve the desired outcome are already included in the current implementation. 

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Turn on the washing machine (Feature: "power_on_off"). 
# User manual reference: "Press this button to switch power on and off."
# Feature name in code: "power_on_off".

# 2. Set the washing program to "Speedy" (Feature: "adjust_program"). 
# User manual reference: "Selects programs. The program changes each time the button is pressed."
# Feature name in code: "adjust_program".

# 3. Set wash time to 10 minutes (Feature: "adjust_wash_time"). 
# User manual reference: "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
# Feature name in code: "adjust_wash_time".

# 4. Set water level to 30L (Feature: "adjust_water_level"). 
# User manual reference: "Changes the water level."
# Feature name in code: "adjust_water_level".

# 5. Set rinse type to "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time" (Feature: "adjust_rinse_type").
# User manual reference: "Changes the number and type of rinses."
# Feature name in code: "adjust_rinse_type".

# 6. Set spin time to 3 minutes (Feature: "adjust_spin_time").
# User manual reference: "Changes the spin time. The spin time can be set between one and 9 minutes."
# Feature name in code: "adjust_spin_time".

# 7. Start the washing machine (Feature: "start_pause").
# User manual reference: "Starts and pauses operation."
# Feature name in code: "start_pause".

# The goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_program to "P3 (Speedy)".
# - Set variable_washing_time to "10".
# - Set variable_water_level to "30".
# - Set variable_rinse_type to "Water-Injection Rinse 1 time".
# - Set variable_spin_time to "3".
# - Set variable_start_running to "start".
