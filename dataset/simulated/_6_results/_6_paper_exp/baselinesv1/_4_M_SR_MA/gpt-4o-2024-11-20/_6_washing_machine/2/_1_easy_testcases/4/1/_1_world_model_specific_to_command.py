# The current code already allows for switching on and selecting 'Rapid' program with a large load size, setting wash time, rinse times, spin time, and starting the cycle.

#    - User manual: "Step 1: Power on your washer. Press the ON/OFF button to power your wash on."
#    - Feature: "power_on_off".
#
# 2. Select 'Rapid' program (Feature: "select_program").
#    - User manual: "Press this button to select your desired washing program. Heavy, Gentle, Normal, Rapid, Soak."
#    - Feature: "select_program".
#
# 3. Set load size to large (Feature: "adjust_load_size").

# The existing feature modeling in the given code is correct and accommodates the user command.

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - variable_power_on_off: "on"
# - variable_program: "Rapid"
# - variable_load_size: "3---large"
# - variable_wash_time: 8
# - variable_rinse_times: 2
# - variable_spin_time: 3
