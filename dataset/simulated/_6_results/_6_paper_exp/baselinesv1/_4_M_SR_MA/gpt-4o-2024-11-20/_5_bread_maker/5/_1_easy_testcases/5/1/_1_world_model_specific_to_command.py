# User comments:
# The given code captures most features described in the user manual, but it does miss the "Ultra Fast-1" program modeling correctly.
# The "Ultra Fast-1" program is part of the program menu and should be modeled explicitly in the feature or variable comments.
# The user manual text indicates the following:
# **Programme 6. ULTRA FAST-1**
# • Time: 58 minutes for 700g loaf only.
# • The breadmaker bakes the bread in 58 minutes. The bread is denser in texture with this setting. You should use slightly hotter water (around 48°C-50°C) and use a cooking thermometer to gauge the water temperature.

# Modifications needed:
# 1. Ensure the "Ultra Fast-1" program is adequately included in the available "menu options" (this is already done via `variable_menu_index`).
# 2. Update the feature list to ensure the needed sequence is clear and processable. Specifically:
#    - Adjust "set_menu" to include the selection of the "Ultra Fast-1" program.
#    - Correctly handle the toggle between starting and stopping the appliance.
# 3. No additional modifications to process_input_string() for handling this command are needed as the meta_actions_on_numbers are already set.

# Sequence for achieving command:
# 1. Navigate the program using the "set_menu" feature to "Ultra Fast-1".
# 2. Select the loaf size as 700g using the "set_loaf_size" feature.
# 3. Set crust color to Medium using the "set_crust_color" feature.
# 4. Set a delay of 2 hours using the "set_delay_timer" feature.
# 5. Start the breadmaker performance using the "start_stop_program" feature.

# The goal variable values to achieve this:
# - Set variable_menu_index to "6" ("Ultra Fast-1 program").
# - Set variable_loaf_size to "700g".
# - Set variable_crust_color to "Medium".
# - Set variable_delay_timer to "120" (2 hours).
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
