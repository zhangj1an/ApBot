# The code provided does not correctly model the relevant appliance feature for this user command.
# The user manual indicates an additional condition that is not accounted for in the current code:
# - User manual states that crust color and loaf size are not adjustable in certain cycles. Specifically, crust is not adjustable in Cycles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and loaf size is not adjustable in Cycles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
# - This means that variables `crust_color` and `loaf_size` should have their adjustability conditionally checked based on the selected cycle.
# - Additionally, variable dependencies for delay timer and starting should also ensure proper handling within cycles.

# Update needed:
# - Modify the features and actions so that they respect these conditions as described in the user manual.
# - Incorporate checks during action execution.

# Below is the updated code.

# Updated feature list with conditional adjustability
