# The current code already appropriately models all relevant features and variables needed to achieve the command.
# Below we list the sequence of features needed to achieve the user command and validate them against the given feature list.

# Sequence of features to achieve the command:
# 1. Adjust the menu to "Basic".
# 2. Adjust the crust color to "Light".
# 3. Adjust the loaf size to "450g".
# 4. Adjust the delay timer to "1:00:00".
# 5. Activate the gluten-free mode.
# 6. Start the bread maker.

# Relevant user manual sections:
# - "MENU" selections and descriptions validate the feature "set_auto_menu".
# - "CRUST COLOUR" adjustment validates the feature "adjust_crust_color".
# - "LOAF SIZE" adjustment validates the feature "adjust_loaf_size".
# - "TIMER" adjustment mechanism validates the feature "adjust_timer".
# - Pressing "Gluten Free" button directly activates the gluten-free mode, validating "activate_gluten_free_mode".
# - Press "START/CANCEL" to start a program, validating the feature "start_or_cancel_program".

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# variable_menu_index = "Basic" (feature: "set_auto_menu")
# variable_crust_color = "Light" (feature: "adjust_crust_color")
# variable_loaf_size = "450g" (feature: "adjust_loaf_size")
# variable_timer = "01:00:00" (feature: "adjust_timer")
# variable_gluten_free_mode = "on" (feature: "activate_gluten_free_mode")
# variable_start_running = "on" (feature: "start_or_cancel_program")
