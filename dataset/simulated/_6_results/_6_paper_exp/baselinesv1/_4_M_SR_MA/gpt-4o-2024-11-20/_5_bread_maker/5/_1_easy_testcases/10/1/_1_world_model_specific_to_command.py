# 5. "start_stop_program" (Power on and start the operation)
#     - Relevant User Manual Text: "Press START/STOP button to start the breadmaker."
#     - Feature List: feature_list["start_stop_program"]
# 
# Goal Variable Values for this command:
# - variable_menu_index: "1" (Basic Program)
# - variable_loaf_size: "700g"
# - variable_crust_color: "Light"
# - variable_delay_timer: 180 (3 hours)
# - variable_start_running: "on" (Start operation)

# As the code is already accurate, no changes are needed.
