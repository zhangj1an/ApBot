# Based on the user command to prepare basic bread with dark crust, loaf size 2LB, delayed timer for 6 hours, and start the bread maker:
# The provided code correctly models all necessary features relevant to the user manual.
# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Set the menu to "Basic". (feature_list["adjust_menu"])
# 2. Set the crust color to "Dark". (feature_list["adjust_crust_color"])
# 3. Set the loaf size to "2.0LB". (feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"])
# 4. Set the delay timer to 6 hours. (feature_list["adjust_delay_time"])
# 5. Start the bread maker. (feature_list["start_stop_bread_maker"])

# Quoted relevant user manual text:
# - For menu selection: "The Menu button is used to select a program. Each time it is pressed, the program will vary. Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the 12 programs on the LCD display. Select your desired program."
# - For crust selection: "Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust."
# - For loaf size selection: "Press this button to select the desired size of the loaf. Please note the total operation time may vary among loaf sizes."
# - For delay timer: "Begin by determining the when a freshly baked loaf of bread is desired, then press the '+' and 'â€“' buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments. Maximum delay time is 13 hours."
# - For starting the machine: "To start a program, press the START/STOP button once."

# Provided feature list in the code:
# Feature for menu: feature_list["adjust_menu"]
# Feature for crust color: feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
# Feature for loaf size: feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
# Feature for delay time: feature_list["adjust_delay_time"]
# Feature for starting the bread maker: feature_list["start_stop_bread_maker"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# variable_menu_index = "Basic"
# variable_crust_color = "Dark"
# variable_loaf_size = "2.0LB"
# variable_delay_time = 360 (equivalent to 6 hours as 360 minutes = 6 hours * 60)
# variable_start_running = "on"
