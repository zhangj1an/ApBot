# The given Simulator code accurately models the features required to achieve the user command “Make a small, dark-crust quick bread with the quick menu, with a 1-hour timer delay, then start the bread maker.” 

# Here is the sequence of relevant features needed to execute the command:
# 1. `set_menu_and_setting`: This feature allows selecting the menu to "Quick" (variable_menu_index = "4").
#    - User manual text: “For white bread that is required in a shorter time. Bread baked on this setting is usually smaller with a dense texture.”
#    - Feature_list name: "set_menu_and_setting"
# 2. `adjust_crust_color`: This feature adjusts the crust color to "dark" (variable_crust_color).
#    - User manual text: “Colour button: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)”
#    - Feature_list name: "adjust_crust_color"
# 3. `adjust_loaf_size`: This feature adjusts the loaf size to "1.5LB" to make a small loaf (variable_loaf_size).
#    - User manual text: “Loaf size button: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)”
#    - Feature_list name: "adjust_loaf_size"
# 4. `adjust_timer_delay`: This feature sets a 1-hour timer delay (variable_timer_delay = "01:00:00").
#    - User manual text: “Use the timer when you want the bread ready later, or in the morning. A maximum of 13 hours can be set.”
#    - Feature_list name: "adjust_timer_delay"
# 5. `start_stop_operation`: This feature starts the bread maker (variable_start_running = "on").
#    - User manual text: “Start: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts”
#    - Feature_list name: "start_stop_operation"

# Goal variable values to achieve this user command:
# - variable_menu_index = "4" (Quick Menu)
# - variable_crust_color = "dark" (Dark Crust)
# - variable_loaf_size = "1.5LB" (Small Loaf Size)
# - variable_timer_delay = "01:00:00" (1-hour delay)
# - variable_start_running = "on" (Start Running)
