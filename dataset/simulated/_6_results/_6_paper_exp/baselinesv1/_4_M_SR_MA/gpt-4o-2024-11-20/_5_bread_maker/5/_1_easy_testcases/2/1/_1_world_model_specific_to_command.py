# The given code has missed out on accurately modeling the start/stop functionality. 
# As per the user manual: "Press START/STOP button to start or stop the Programmes." 
# The code incorrectly treats the start/stop functionality as a toggle action, with step-by-step modeling.
# Instead, the START/STOP button should directly toggle the variable_start_running between "on" and "off" depending
# on the current state, without the need to strictly follow steps. Below is the corrected and extended code.
