# The current code accurately models the required appliance features to achieve the user command:
# "Set the bread maker for a large, light-crust dough using the dough setting for a timer delay of 3 hours, then start the bread maker."
# Here is the sequence of features needed, relevant user manual text, and feature list names in the given code:

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. "set_menu_and_setting" - Use "press_menu_button" to set the program to "Dough".
# 2. "adjust_loaf_size" - Use "press_loaf_size_button" to set the loaf size to "large (2LB)".
# 3. "adjust_crust_color" - (This step will default to light crust as per current variable starting value "light").
# 4. "adjust_timer_delay" - Use "press_time_up_button" to set timer delay to 3 hours.
# 5. "start_stop_operation" - Use "press_start_stop_button" to start the bread maker.

# Relevant User Manual Text:
# - **Menu button**: For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12.
# - **Loaf size button**: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only).
# - **Colour button**: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only).
# - **Timer delay buttons**: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake).
# - **Start**: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts.

# Feature List Names in Code:
# - feature_list["set_menu_and_setting"]
# - feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
# - feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
# - feature_list["adjust_timer_delay"]
# - feature_list["start_stop_operation"]

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_menu_index": "8",  # Dough program
    "variable_loaf_size": "2LB",  # Large loaf size
    "variable_crust_color": "light",  # Light crust
    "variable_timer_delay": "03:00:00",  # 3 hours delay
    "variable_start_running": "on",  # Start the bread maker
