# The given Simulator class seems to adequately model the commands and features described in the user manual for the Bread Maker.
# Here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the user command, followed by the relevant user manual text:

# User Command:
# Prepare Sweet bread with a light crust, ready for a picnic, loaf size is 2.0lb, set the timer to 3 hours from now, and start the bread maker.

# Sequence of Features Needed:
# 1. Adjust the menu to "Sweet" — feature_list["adjust_menu"].
# 2. Adjust the crust color to "Light" — feature_list["adjust_crust_color"].
# 3. Adjust the loaf size to "2.0LB" — feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"].
# 4. Adjust the delay time to 3 hours (180 minutes) — feature_list["adjust_delay_time"].
# 5. Start the bread maker — feature_list["start_stop_bread_maker"].

# Relevant User Manual Text:
# - “Sweet: Kneading, rising and baking sweet bread. You may also add ingredients to alter the flavor.”
# - “…Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust.”
# - “Press the LOAF button to select the desired size of the loaf (1.5LB or 2.0LB).”
# - “To delay the timer, use the ‘+’ and ‘–’ buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments.”
# - “Press START/STOP button once to start the selected baking program…”

# Given the features and their accurate mapping of variables, no missing features or corrections are required for this simulator.

# Goal Variable Values to Achieve the Command:
# variable_menu_index = "Sweet"
# variable_crust_color = "Light"
# variable_loaf_size = "2.0LB"
# variable_delay_time = 180 (corresponds to 3 hours in minutes)
# variable_start_running = "on"
