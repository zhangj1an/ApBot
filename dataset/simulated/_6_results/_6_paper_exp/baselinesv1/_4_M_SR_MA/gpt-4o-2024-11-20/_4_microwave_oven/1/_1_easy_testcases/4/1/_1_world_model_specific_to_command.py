# Python comments regarding the user command and current feature list:
# The current feature list models the microwave cooking process correctly as per the user manual.
# Relevant feature_list required to achieve this user command:
# 1. "microwave_cook" -> Allows user to set cooking time and power level.
# 2. "start_cooking" is bundled under the pressing of "press_start_plus_30sec_button" in the feature step 5 of "microwave_cook".
# Raw User Manual Text:
# **MICROWAVE COOK**:
# 1. Press "TIME COOK" once, screen will display "00:00".
# 2. Press number keys to input the cooking time; the maximum cooking time is 99 minutes and 99 seconds.
# 3. Press "POWER" once, screen will display "PL10". The default power is 100% power. Now you can press number keys to adjust the power level.
# 4. Press "START/+30SEC." to start cooking.
# The feature list models this completely as "microwave_cook".
# Action effects and variable processing are correctly modeled in the `process_input_string` method for both cooking time and power. 

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_time_cook_time: "00:09:00" (9 minutes cooking time)
# variable_power: "PL6" (60% power level)
# variable_start_running: "on" (start the appliance).
