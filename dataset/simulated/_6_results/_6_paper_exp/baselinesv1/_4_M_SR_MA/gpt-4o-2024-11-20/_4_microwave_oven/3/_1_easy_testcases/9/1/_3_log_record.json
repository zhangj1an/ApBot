However, based on rule 5, if there is a better match for 'upper_and_lower_tubes' in the options, the feedback value would not match perfectly. Here, the goal value 'upper_and_lower_tubes' matches better than the feedback value 'upper and lower heating tube with convection', as it is the intended concise option."
