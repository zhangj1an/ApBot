# User manual text suggests the following adjustments for the preparation of cookies:
# 
# - "**BAKE**": "Set the upper and lower heating elements to 350°F... Close glass doors completely. Turn the timer knob to the desired cooking time per your recipe..."
# - User manual describes setting temperature, dial functions, and timer configurations with specific dials.

# **Analysis**:
# The current Simulator code correctly models variables and actions required for "setting the upper element temperature to 350°F", "the function to Bake", "lower element temperature to 450°F", and "set timer to 40 minutes".

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Adjust upper element temperature: Feature - "set_upper_element_temperature", actions: ["turn_upper_element_temperature_dial_clockwise", "turn_upper_element_temperature_dial_anticlockwise"].
# 2. Adjust lower element temperature: Feature - "set_lower_element_temperature", actions: ["turn_lower_element_temperature_dial_clockwise", "turn_lower_element_temperature_dial_anticlockwise"].
# 3. Adjust the function to Bake mode: Feature - "set_function_dial", actions: ["turn_function_dial_clockwise", "turn_function_dial_anticlockwise"].
# 4. Adjust timer to 40 minutes: Feature - "set_timer", actions: ["turn_timer_dial_clockwise", "turn_timer_dial_anticlockwise"].

# **Raw User Manual Features Matches:**
# - Temperature is controlled via dials for both upper and lower elements.
# - Function dial has a "Bake" mode (implicitly inferred by how the Function knob description matches bake-related scenarios like cookies).
# - Timer "must be set to a desired time to begin heating".

# Since the current code faithfully represents all these steps and variables, no alterations are necessary.

# Finally, the goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# - `variable_upper_element_temperature` to "350".
# - `variable_lower_element_temperature` to "450".
# - `variable_function_dial` to "Toast/Broil" (since "Bake" mode aligns with the cookbook recipe described).
# - `variable_timer` to 40 (minutes, converted as per user manual dial values).
