# Python comment explaining the code's accuracy in modeling the command
# The code correctly models the relevant appliance features described in the user manual
# The sequence of features needed to achieve the user command is as follows:
# 1. Feature: "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" to adjust the upper tube temperature to 110°C.
#    User manual text: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    Feature_list name: "adjust_upper_tube_temperature"
# 2. Feature: "adjust_function_selection" to select the cooking function as "upper and lower heating tubes."
#    User manual text: "Select cooking function ... ☐ The upper and lower heating tubes are working during this function."
#    Feature_list name: "adjust_function_selection"
# 3. Feature: "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" to set the lower tube temperature to 70°C.
#    User manual text: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    Feature_list name: "adjust_lower_tube_temperature"
# 4. Feature: "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" to set the timer for 50 minutes and also start the appliance.
#    User manual text: "Adjust cooking time ... If the cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, then turn the time knob back to the desired time position."
#    Feature_list name: "adjust_cooking_time_and_start"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_upper_tube_temperature: 110
# variable_function_selection: "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# variable_lower_tube_temperature: 70
# variable_time_adjustment: 50
# variable_start_running: "on"
