# Python comment:
# Upon reviewing the user manual and the provided simulator code, I confirm that the code has correctly modeled the relevant features and variables to achieve the user command:
# "Start the microwave. Set the upper tube temperature to 150째C, select the cooking function as upper and lower heating tube, set the lower tube temperature to 190째C, and adjust the cooking time to 30 minutes."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Use the "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" feature to set the upper tube temperature to 150째C.
# 2. Use the "adjust_function_selection" feature to set the cooking function to "upper and lower heating tube."
# 3. Use the "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" feature to set the lower tube temperature to 190째C.
# 4. Use the "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" feature to set the cooking time to 30 minutes and automatically start the microwave.

# Relevant user manual text and feature_list names:
# - User manual: "Adjust the upper tube temperature..." -> Feature: "adjust_upper_tube_temperature"
# - User manual: "The upper and lower heating tubes heat up at the same time..." -> Feature: "adjust_function_selection"
# - User manual: "Adjust the lower tube temperature..." -> Feature: "adjust_lower_tube_temperature"
# - User manual: "Adjust cooking time... The oven starts cooking." -> Feature: "adjust_cooking_time_and_start"

# Goal variable values:
# - variable_upper_tube_temperature: 150
# - variable_function_selection: "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# - variable_lower_tube_temperature: 190
# - variable_time_adjustment: 30
# - variable_start_running: "on"
