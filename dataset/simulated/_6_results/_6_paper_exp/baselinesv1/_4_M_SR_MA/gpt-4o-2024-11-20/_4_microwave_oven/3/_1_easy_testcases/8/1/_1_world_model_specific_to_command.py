# Python comments explaining the steps:

# The raw user manual specifies the following relevant features:
# 1. Adjust the upper tube temperature: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. 
#    The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    (feature_list ["adjust_upper_tube_temperature"])
# 2. Select cooking function: "Select cooking function. 
#    Functions described are lower heating tube, upper heating tube, upper and lower heating tubes, upper and lower heating tubes with convection, 
#    and upper heating tube with rotisserie motor."
#    (feature_list ["adjust_function_selection"])
# 3. Adjust the lower tube temperature: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. 
#    The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    (feature_list ["adjust_lower_tube_temperature"])
# 4. Set cooking time and start the machine: "Adjust cooking time. If cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, 
#    then turn the knob back to the desired time. Selecting 'Stay On' activates a continuous working state."
#    (feature_list ["adjust_cooking_time_and_start"])

# The initial simulator code does correctly model and combine these features.
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this user command:
# 1. "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" to set the upper tube temperature to "230°C".
# 2. "adjust_function_selection" to set the cooking function to "upper and lower heating tube".
# 3. "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" to set the lower tube temperature to "110°C".
# 4. "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" to set the cooking time to "40 minutes" and start the machine.

# No additional features or variables need to be created or modified. The given model already implements the necessary functionality.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. variable_upper_tube_temperature = 230
# 2. variable_function_selection = "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# 3. variable_lower_tube_temperature = 110
# 4. variable_time_adjustment = 40
# 5. variable_start_running = "on"
