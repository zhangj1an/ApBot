# The current implementation correctly models the variable and feature adjustments needed to achieve the user's command.
# The user command requires selecting the Rotisserie function, setting the upper and lower element temperatures to 450°F,
# and setting the timer to 60 minutes. This corresponds to the following features in the feature_list:

# 1. `set_function_dial` – Use this to turn the function dial to "Rotisserie."
# 2. `set_upper_element_temperature` – Use this to set the upper element temperature to 450°F.
# 3. `set_lower_element_temperature` – Use this to set the lower element temperature to 450°F.
# 4. `set_timer` – Use this to manually set the timer to 60 minutes.

# Relevant parts of the user manual:
# 1. "Function Dial – Use this dial to set Convection, Rotisserie or Convection Rotisserie."
# 2. "Temperature Dial for Upper Elements Only – Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake, Broil, Toast, or Rotisserie."
# 3. "Temperature Dial for Lower Elements Only – Use this dial to set the temperature for Keep Warm, Bake, or Toast."
# 4. "Timer Dial – This dial must be set to a desired time to begin heating."
# 5. "NOTE: If cook time is less than 20 minutes, you must turn Timer past the 20 minute mark to engage the timer then back to desired time."

# The fully modeled features:
# - `set_function_dial`
# - `set_upper_element_temperature`
# - `set_lower_element_temperature`
# - `set_timer`

# The goal variable states:
# - `variable_function_dial` = "Rotisserie"
# - `variable_upper_element_temperature` = "450"
# - `variable_lower_element_temperature` = "450"
# - `variable_timer` = 60

# Since the current code models these features accurately, no changes are needed. 
# Here is the ExtendedSimulator, confirming the goals and execution steps remain achievable.
