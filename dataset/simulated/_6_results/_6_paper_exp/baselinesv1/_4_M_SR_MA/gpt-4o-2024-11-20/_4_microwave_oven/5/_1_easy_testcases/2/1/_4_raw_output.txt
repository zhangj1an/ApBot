Feedback Variable: 

 variable_temperature_dial: 100°c 


Comparison result: 

 Let's analyze the feedback and goal requirements.

**Goal:**  
variable_temperature_dial = "100°C"

**Feedback:**  
variable_temperature_dial: "100°c"

---

### Step-by-step Comparison Based on Rules:

1. **Variable Name Match:**  
   - The variable names are identical: `variable_temperature_dial`.  
   - Proceed to compare the values.

2. **Value Capitalization/Formatting:**  
   - The goal state's value is "100°C".  
   - The feedback value is "100°c".  
   - They differ only in capitalization ("C" vs. "c").  
   - Per Rule 2, values that differ only by capitalization or formatting (but semantically are the same) are considered equivalent.  

---

### Conclusion:  

reason = "The feedback value '100°c' differs from the goal value '100°C' only in capitalization, which is not semantically significant. Therefore, they match as per Rule 2."  
goal_reached = True 


Execution failed on attempt 1: EOL while scanning string literal (<string>, line 1)
Comparison result: 

 reason = "The feedback value '100°c' and the target goal value '100°C' only differ in capitalization. Both represent the same value according to Rule 2, as the difference is only in textual formatting."

Feedback Variable: 

 variable_function_dial: convection 


Comparison result: 

 Given the context and rules:

- **Goal:** variable_function_dial = "Convection"
- **Feedback:** variable_function_dial = "convection"  

We compare the values according to the rules:

1. Both the goal and feedback have the same variable name (`variable_function_dial`), so we only need to compare the values.
2. The goal value is "Convection" and the feedback value is "convection."
3. Rule 2 states that if the values differ only in capitalization, they should be considered semantically the same. "Convection" and "convection" only differ by capitalization.

Thus:

reason = "The values 'Convection' and 'convection' only differ in capitalization, which makes them semantically equivalent based on Rule 2."
