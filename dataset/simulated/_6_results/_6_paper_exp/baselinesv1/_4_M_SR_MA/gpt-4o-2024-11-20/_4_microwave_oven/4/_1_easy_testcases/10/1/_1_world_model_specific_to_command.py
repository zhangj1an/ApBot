# The requested user command is: "Turn on the microwave to prepare a batch of cookies. 
# Set the upper heater temperature to 190 °C, the lower heater temperature to 190 °C, 
# the timer to 20 minutes, and use the upper heater function."

# After reviewing the given user manual text and the current code, an important feature is missing:
# There is no feature or variable to start the operation or to "turn on the microwave" 
# explicitly mentioned in the code. 
# The user manual does not provide direct information about a power button, 
# so I cannot directly model it here.

# The current code accurately models the relevant appliance features required 
# to execute the command:
# - Feature "set_function_knob" models setting the function knob to the "Upper Heater" function.
# - Features "adjust_upper_heater_temperature" and "adjust_lower_heater_temperature" model 
#   setting the upper and lower heater temperatures to 190 °C.
# - Feature "set_timer" models setting the timer to 20 minutes.
# These features are sufficient to address the user command.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. "set_function_knob" - Set the function knob to "Upper Heater."
# 2. "adjust_upper_heater_temperature" - Adjust the upper heater temperature to 190 °C.
# 3. "adjust_lower_heater_temperature" - Adjust the lower heater temperature to 190 °C.
# 4. "set_timer" - Set the timer to 20 minutes.

# Relevant user manual text:
# - For Function knob: "**Function knob:** □ Operates the upper heater."
# - For Temperature knobs: "**Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs:** Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C."
# - For Timer: "**Timer:** The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches '0'."

# Relevant feature names in the provided code:
# - Feature "set_function_knob"
# - Feature "adjust_upper_heater_temperature"
# - Feature "adjust_lower_heater_temperature"
# - Feature "set_timer"

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_function_knob` to "Upper Heater."
# - Set `variable_upper_heater_temperature` to 190.
# - Set `variable_lower_heater_temperature` to 190.
# - Set `variable_timer` to "20".
