# The currently provided code represents the user manual instructions correctly for the requested command "Defrost using time defrost for 10 minutes with 60% power, then start the appliance." 
# Here are the steps mapped correctly to the feature list:
# 1. Use the feature "time_defrost" to set time defrost to 10 minutes (variable_time_defrost).
# 2. Adjust power to 60% (variable_power).
# 3. Start the appliance using the "press_start_plus_30sec_button" action.

# The raw text from the user manual that verifies this:
# "7. TIME DEFROST FUNCTION
# 1. Press 'TIME DEFROST', screen will display 'dEF2'.
# 2. Press number pads to input defrosting time. The effective time range is 00:01~99:99.
# 3. The default microwave power is power level 3. If you want to change the power level, press 'POWER' once, and the screen will display 'PL 3', then press the number pad of the power level you wanted.
# 4. Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start defrosting. The remained cooking time will be displayed."

# The corresponding feature:
# feature_list["time_defrost"]

# Therefore, no changes to the features or variables are required for this command.
