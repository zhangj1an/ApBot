# User command checks
# The original code already models the necessary features and variables to achieve the given user command.
# The sequence of features needed to achieve the command is:
# 1. "general_cooking" - to adjust temperature, function, selector mode, and timer as described in the user command.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_temperature_dial = "150Â°C"
# variable_function_dial = "Convection"
# variable_selector_dial = "Top & Bottom Heating"
