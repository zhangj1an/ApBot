# The given code is checked against the user command, and there is an issue:
# Upon analyzing the user manual, the code does not model whether the appliance starts running after the dials are configured. 
# The user manual does not mention a power_on_off button, so the appliance should start automatically once all the configurations are set.
# This behavior is not represented in the given feature list or code.

# Relevant user manual text:
# "Heating will commence immediately after setting the Timer dial."
# "Plug the power cable to the electric mains and switch it ON."
# The simulator should reflect that heating starts automatically after the timer is set.

# Correction: Introduce a variable `variable_start_running` to reflect the state of the appliance (running or not),
# and modify the feature `general_cooking` and `rotisserie_use` to include automatic starting based on the user manual.

# Adding the required variable and adjusting the feature list
variable_start_running = DiscreteVariable(
    value_range=["off", "on"],

# Sequence of Features: ["general_cooking"]
# User Manual Text:
# To prepare fish sticks, set the temperature to 200°C, function dial to "Convection", selector dial to "Top & Bottom Heating", and timer to "20".
# Relevant features: "general_cooking" accurately represents this procedure now.
# Goal variable values:
# - variable_temperature_dial: "200°C"
# - variable_function_dial: "Convection"
# - variable_selector_dial: "Top & Bottom Heating"
# - variable_timer_dial: "20 minutes"
