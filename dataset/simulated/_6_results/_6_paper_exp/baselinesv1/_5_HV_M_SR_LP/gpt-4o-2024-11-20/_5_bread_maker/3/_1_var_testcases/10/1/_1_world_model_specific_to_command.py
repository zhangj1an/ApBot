# 2. Feature: "adjust_crust_color" -> Action: "press_crust_button" -> Variable: "variable_crust_color"
# 3. Feature: "adjust_loaf_size" -> Action: "press_loaf_size_button" -> Variable: "variable_loaf_size"
# 4. Feature: "adjust_delay_timer" -> Actions: "press_delay_timer_plus_button", "press_delay_timer_minus_button" -> Variable: "variable_delay_timer"
# 5. Feature: "start_or_stop_operation" -> Action: "press_start_stop_button" -> Variable: "variable_start_running"
