# The requested user command is to prepare a small loaf of sweet bread with a medium crust color, 1.5LB loaf size, delay timer to 6 hours from now, and start the bread maker.

# Verifying if the given code is sufficient to fulfill the command:
# The code includes `adjust_menu`, `adjust_crust_color`, `adjust_loaf_size`, `adjust_delay_time`, and `start_stop_bread_maker` as features.
# These features cover necessary steps to select "Sweet" menu, set "Medium" crust color, set "1.5LB" loaf size, set delay time to 6 hours, and start the bread maker.
# Thus, the user manual features are accurately modeled as per the provided functionality.

# Steps to achieve the user command using the provided code:
# 1. Use "adjust_menu" to set `variable_menu_index` to "Sweet".
# 2. Use "adjust_crust_color" to set `variable_crust_color` to "Medium".
# 3. Use "adjust_loaf_size" to set `variable_loaf_size` to "1.5LB".
# 4. Use "adjust_delay_time" to set `variable_delay_time` to 360 (6 hours * 60 minutes).
# 5. Use "start_stop_bread_maker" to set `variable_start_running` to "on".

# Relevant user manual text:
# - **Menu Selection**: "The Menu button is used to select a program. Each time it is pressed, the program will vary. Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the 12 programs on the LCD display."
# - **Crust Color Selection**: "Use the Color button to select a LIGHT, MEDIUM or DARK color for the crust."
# - **Loaf Size Selection**: "Press this button to select the desired size of the loaf. The total operation time may vary among loaf sizes."
# - **Delay Function**: "Use this button to delay the start time for your desired program, in 10-minute increments. The maximum delay time is 13 hours."
# - **Start/Stop Bread Maker**: "To start a program, press the START/STOP button once. To stop, press it for approx. 2 seconds."

# Feature list from the given code:
# - `adjust_menu`: Allows setting `variable_menu_index`.
# - `adjust_crust_color`: Allows setting `variable_crust_color`.
# - `adjust_loaf_size`: Allows setting `variable_loaf_size`.
# - `adjust_delay_time`: Allows setting `variable_delay_time`.
# - `start_stop_bread_maker`: Allows toggling `variable_start_running`.

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_menu_index` = "Sweet"
# - `variable_crust_color` = "Medium"
# - `variable_loaf_size` = "1.5LB"
# - `variable_delay_time` = 360 (6 hours)
# - `variable_start_running` = "on"
