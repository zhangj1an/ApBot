# The current code accurately models the relevant appliance features based on the user manual.
# The sequence of features required to achieve the user command is as follows:
# 1. "select_cycle" to set the cycle to 'Sweet'.
# 2. "adjust_crust_color" to choose 'Light' crust color.
# 3. "adjust_loaf_size" to set the loaf size to '2-lb'.
# 4. "adjust_delay_timer" to set the delay timer to 2 hours.
# 5. "start_or_stop_operation" to start the bread maker.

# Relevant user manual text: 
# - "Press CYCLE button to select your desired cycle. The corresponding cycle number is shown on the display."
# - "Press CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust."
# - "Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size."
# - "Use the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time. Press the + and â€“ buttons to increase the cycle time shown on the display."
# - "Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle."

# The implemented feature names are:
# feature_list["select_cycle"]
# feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
# feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
# feature_list["adjust_delay_timer"]
# feature_list["start_or_stop_operation"]

# Code to generate goal variable values to achieve this command:
class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator):
    def generate_goal_state(self):
        # Set the goal state based on the user command
        goal_state = {
            "variable_cycle": "Sweet",
            "variable_crust_color": "Light",
            "variable_loaf_size": "2.0lb",
            "variable_delay_timer": 120,  # 2 hours as minutes
            "variable_start_running": "on"
        }
        return goal_state
