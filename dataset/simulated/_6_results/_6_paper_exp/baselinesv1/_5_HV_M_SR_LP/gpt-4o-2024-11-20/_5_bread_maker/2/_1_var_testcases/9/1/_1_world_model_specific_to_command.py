# The current code accurately models the appliance features needed to achieve the command.
# Relevant user manual text related to the task:
# - "Menu button: For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12"
# - "Loaf size button: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)"
# - "Colour button: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)"
# - "Timer delay buttons: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)"
# - "Start: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts"

# Features in the code that map to the user manual:
# - "set_menu_and_setting" for adjusting the menu to "Cake" (menu index "10").
# - "adjust_crust_color" for setting the crust color to "light".
# - "adjust_loaf_size" for setting the loaf size to "small" (1.5LB).
# - "adjust_timer_delay" for setting a 3-hour timer delay.
# - "start_stop_operation" for starting the bread maker.

# Sequence of features to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "set_menu_and_setting" to set variable_menu_index to "10" (Cake menu).
# 2. Use "adjust_crust_color" to set variable_crust_color to "light".
# 3. Use "adjust_loaf_size" to set variable_loaf_size to "1.5LB".
# 4. Use "adjust_timer_delay" to set variable_timer_delay to "03:00:00".
# 5. Use "start_stop_operation" to set variable_start_running to "on".

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# variable_menu_index = "10"
# variable_menu_setting = variable_menu_setting_10  # Automatically linked through menu_setting_dict
# variable_crust_color = "light"
# variable_loaf_size = "1.5LB"
# variable_timer_delay = "03:00:00"
# variable_start_running = "on"
