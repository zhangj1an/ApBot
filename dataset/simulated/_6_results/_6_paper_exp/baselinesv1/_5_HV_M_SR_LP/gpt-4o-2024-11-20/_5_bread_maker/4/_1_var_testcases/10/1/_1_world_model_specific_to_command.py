# Based on the provided user command, we will review the given code's accuracy in modeling the relevant appliance features and variables.

# Relevant user manual text to validate the requested user command:
# 1. "Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen."
# 2. "To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark (and Rapid) on the display screen."
# 3. "To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen."
# 4. "Press up arrow or down arrow to increase or decrease start time. Press up arrow to increase in 10 minute increments. Press down arrow to decrease in 10 minutes increments."
# 5. "Press to go directly to the gluten free bread function."
# 6. "Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program."

# Features listed in the given code and related user manual:
# feature_list["set_auto_menu"],
# feature_list["adjust_crust_color"],
# feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"],
# feature_list["adjust_timer"],
# feature_list["activate_gluten_free_mode"],
# feature_list["start_or_cancel_program"]

# The given code has appropriately modeled the relevant features needed to achieve this request. 
# Each step in the user manual appears to be accurately represented in the code, and all necessary variables and features exist.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Set the auto menu to "French" using the feature "set_auto_menu."
# 2. Adjust the crust color to "Medium" using the feature "adjust_crust_color."
# 3. Adjust the loaf size to "900g" using the feature "adjust_loaf_size."
# 4. Set a 3-hour timer using the feature "adjust_timer."
# 5. Activate the Gluten Free mode using the feature "activate_gluten_free_mode."
# 6. Start the program using the feature "start_or_cancel_program."

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_menu_index -> "French"
# - variable_crust_color -> "Medium"
# - variable_loaf_size -> "900g"
# - variable_timer -> "03:00:00"
# - variable_gluten_free_mode -> "on"
# - variable_start_running -> "on"
