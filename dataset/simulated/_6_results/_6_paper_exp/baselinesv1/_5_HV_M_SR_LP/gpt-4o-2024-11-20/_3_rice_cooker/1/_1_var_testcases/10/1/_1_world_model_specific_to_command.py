# The current user command is to cook glutinous rice, set cooking time to 1 hour and 10 minutes, then start.
# Upon reviewing the provided user manual and comparing it with the existing code, the following discrepancies are observed:

# Missing Implementation:
# 1. Setting the cooking mode to "Glutinous rice" is needed for this feature, 
#    but it is unclear whether the cooking mode has been explicitly linked to "variable_cooking_mode".
#    User manual text: Step 7 states, "Press the 'Menu' button to select the desired function."
#    The code already has "set_cooking_mode" as a feature.
#
# 2. Adjusting cooking time involves a unified feature "adjust_cooking_time," 
#    which is present in the code.
#
# 3. Lastly, starting the appliance can be handled by the feature "start_appliance."
# 
# Thus, the current implementation already models these features sufficiently, following the user manual.

# As per the user command, the sequence of features needed to achieve this goal is:
# - Feature: "set_cooking_mode"
#   Step: Use `press_menu_button` to set "variable_cooking_mode" to "Glutinous rice."
#   User Manual Reference: "Step 7: Press the 'Menu' button to select the desired function."
#   Feature List Name: `set_cooking_mode`
#
# - Feature: "adjust_cooking_time"
#   Step: Use `press_cooking_time_button`, adjust hours using `press_hr_button` to 1, and minutes using `press_min_button` to 10.
#   User Manual Reference: "Press the 'Cooking time' button."
#   Feature List Name: `adjust_cooking_time`
#
# - Feature: "start_appliance"
#   Step: Use `press_start_button` to set the variable "variable_start_running" to "on."
#   User Manual Reference: "Press the 'Start' button."
#   Feature List Name: `start_appliance`
#
# Goal Variable Values to achieve the command:
# - `variable_cooking_mode`: "Glutinous rice"
# - `variable_cooking_time_hr`: 1
# - `variable_cooking_time_min`: 10
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
