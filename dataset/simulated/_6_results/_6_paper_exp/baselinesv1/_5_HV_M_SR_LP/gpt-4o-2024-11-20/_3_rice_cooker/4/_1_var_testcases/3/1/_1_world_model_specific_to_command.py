# The requested user command is: Cook 'PORRIDGE' with a reserved start time of 1 hour from now, then start the machine.

# Reviewing the provided code and user manual description:
# The feature for setting the delay time and starting the cooking process is correctly modeled.
# The feature for toggling the menu to 'PORRIDGE' is also correctly modeled.
# This can be achieved using the following sequence of steps:
#   1. Select 'PORRIDGE' using the "set_menu" feature.
#   2. Set the reservation time to 1 hour using the "set_delay_time" feature.
#   3. Start the machine using the "start_cooking" feature.
# The feature_list names utilized are:
# - feature_list["set_menu"]
# - feature_list["set_delay_time"]
# - feature_list["start_cooking"]

# Relevant raw user manual text:
#   - "Set the timer for cooking completion: Press the “DELAY” button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
#   - "Start cooking: Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."
#   - "Select Quick Rice or other functions by using the Quick Rice or MENU button."

# No additional features or variables are needed since everything required is already implemented.
