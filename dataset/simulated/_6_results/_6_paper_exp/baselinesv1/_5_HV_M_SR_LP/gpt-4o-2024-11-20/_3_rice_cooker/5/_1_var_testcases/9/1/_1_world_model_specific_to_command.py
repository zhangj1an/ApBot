# The current code is already accurate in modeling the required appliance functionality for the user command.
# Based on the user manual and descriptions provided, here is the analysis:

# To achieve the user command "Turn on the rice cooker in quick cooking steam mode with variable_timer set to 20 minutes. Then start the machine.", the following steps are needed:
# 
# **Relevant features to achieve this command:**
# 1. Use feature_list["select_cooking_program"] to set the program to "quick_cooking_steam".
#    - User manual relevant text: "Press the corresponding button for `Quick Cooking/Steam` to choose the program."
# 2. Use feature_list["adjust_timer"] to set the timer to 20 minutes.
#    - User manual relevant text: "Press `Timer` to adjust the time for certain programs like Congee/Soup, Slow Cook/Stew, Reheat."
# 3. Use feature_list["start_appliance"] to start the appliance.
#    - User manual relevant text: "Press the `Start` button to start cooking once cooking program and other adjustments are finalized."
#
# **Features in the given code:**
# - feature_list["select_cooking_program"]: This accurately models the action of choosing the desired cooking program.
# - feature_list["adjust_timer"]: This accurately models the timer adjustment process using the "press_timer_button" action.
# - feature_list["start_appliance"]: This accurately models starting the appliance using the "press_start_button" action.
#
# **Goal variable values for the command:**
# - Set `variable_cooking_program` to "quick_cooking_steam".
# - Set `variable_timer` to 20 minutes.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
