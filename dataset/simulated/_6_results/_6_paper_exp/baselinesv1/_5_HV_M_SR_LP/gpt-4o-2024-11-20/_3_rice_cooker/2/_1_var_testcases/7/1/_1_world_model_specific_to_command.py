# User manual analysis:
# The user command is to: Set the mode to congee, set timer to 5 hours, and start the machine.
# From the already provided user manual and code, we can verify whether the features necessary to achieve this task are correctly implemented.

# Relevant sections:
# 1. Setting the cooking mode:
# "Press Menu/Cancel to choose a cooking function (e.g., Fast cook, White rice, Congee, Soup, Cake, Keep warm)."
# The provided code feature list includes:
# feature_list["select_cooking_mode"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_menu_cancel_button"], "variable": "variable_cooking_mode"}
# ]
# This allows adjusting the cooking mode using the "press_menu_cancel_button". This is accurate for selecting "congee" mode.

# 2. Setting the timer:
# "Choose a function you need, Press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer. The preset time is up to 24 hours."
# The provided code feature list includes:
# feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_preset_time_time_button"], "variable": "variable_preset_timer"}
# ]
# The timer can be adjusted in 15-minute increments up to 24 hours (1440 minutes), which is correctly modelled.

# 3. Starting the machine:
# "Press Start to start the cooking process."
# The provided code feature list includes:
# feature_list["start_cooking"] = [
#     {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_button"], "variable": "variable_start_running", "comment": "value always set to on"}
# ]
# This correctly models starting the cooking process.

# Conclusion:
# The current implementation already supports the user command:
# - Adjust cooking mode to "congee" using feature_list["select_cooking_mode"].
# - Set timer to 5 hours (300 minutes) using feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"].
# - Start the machine using feature_list["start_cooking"].

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use feature_list["select_cooking_mode"] to set variable_cooking_mode to "congee".
# 2. Use feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"] to set variable_preset_timer to 300 minutes (5 hours).
# 3. Use feature_list["start_cooking"] to set variable_start_running to "on".

# Goal variable values:
# variable_cooking_mode = "congee"
# variable_preset_timer = 300 (minutes)
# variable_start_running = "on"
