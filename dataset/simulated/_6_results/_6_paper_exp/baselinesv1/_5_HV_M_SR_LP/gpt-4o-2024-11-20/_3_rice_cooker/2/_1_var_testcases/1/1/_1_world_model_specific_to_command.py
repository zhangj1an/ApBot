# Python comments outlining the reasoning:
# The given code correctly models the functions needed to achieve the user command, which involves setting the mode to "congee",
# setting the preset timer to 8 hours (480 minutes as the preset timer step is in minutes), and starting the machine.
# Based on the user manual, the following steps are required:
# - "press_menu_cancel_button" to select the cooking mode.
# - "press_preset_time_time_button" to adjust the preset timer.
# - "press_start_button" to start the operation.

# Quoted user manual text relevant to the user command:
# - Cooking mode: "Press Menu/Cancel to choose Congee (bowl symbol) or Soup (steam symbol)..."
# - Timer: "Choose a function you need, Press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer... the preset timer should be longer than cooking time."
# - Start: "Press Start to start the cooking process."

# The corresponding feature_list names in the provided code:
# - "select_cooking_mode" for setting the cooking mode.
# - "adjust_preset_timer" for setting the preset timer.
# - "start_cooking" for starting the cooking process.

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_cooking_mode` to "congee".
# - Set `variable_preset_timer` to 480 (minutes).
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
