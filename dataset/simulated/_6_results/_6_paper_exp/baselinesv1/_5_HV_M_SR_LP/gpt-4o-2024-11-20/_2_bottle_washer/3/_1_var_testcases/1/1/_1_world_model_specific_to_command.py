# The provided code has accurately modeled the relevant appliance features described in the user manual.
# Below is the step-by-step alignment between the user command, the user manual, and the code:

# 1. **Turn on the bottle washer**: 
#    The feature for power control is present in the code as `"power_control"`, with the action `"press_and_hold_power_button"`.
#    - User manual: "Press and hold the 'Power' button for 3 seconds to turn on the Bottle Washer Pro®."

# 2. **Set it to 'Wash & Dry' mode**:
#    The feature for choosing wash modes is present in the code as `"choose_wash_mode"`, with the action `"press_wash_mode_button"` adjusting `variable_wash_mode`.
#    - User manual: "Touch the 'wash mode' button to choose a wash cycle."
#      Wash mode options are modeled correctly in `variable_wash_mode` with the option "Wash & Dry".

# 3. **Press start to begin**:
#    The feature for starting the cycle is present in the code as `"start_cycle"`, with the action `"press_start_pause_button"` setting `variable_start_running`.
#    - User manual: "Press the 'Start/Pause' button to start the Bottle Washer Pro®."

# Hence, the given code has all necessary features and actions implemented to achieve the user command.
# The sequence of features required to achieve this command is:
# - "power_control" (action: press_and_hold_power_button)
# - "choose_wash_mode" (action: press_wash_mode_button)
# - "start_cycle" (action: press_start_pause_button)

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_wash_mode`: "Wash & Dry"
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
