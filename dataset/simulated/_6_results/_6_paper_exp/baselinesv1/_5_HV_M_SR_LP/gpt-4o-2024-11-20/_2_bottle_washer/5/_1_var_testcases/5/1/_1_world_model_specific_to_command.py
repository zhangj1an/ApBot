# The current code is already accurate and correctly models all relevant appliance features to achieve the command. 
# Below is the sequence of steps to execute the command and the rationale:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Feature: "power_on_off" to switch the sterilizer on.
#    User manual: "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off." -> relevant feature: "power_on_off".
# 2. Feature: "auto_mode" to set the sterilization cycle to 60 minutes.
#    User manual: "Press this button to start a drying then sterilising cycle. Press twice for 60 minutes cycle, 25 minutes drying, and 35 minutes sterilising." -> relevant feature: "auto_mode".
# 3. Feature: "storage_function" to turn storage mode on.
#    User manual: "Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser." -> relevant feature: "storage_function".

# Target variable values for the command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_auto_mode_duration` to "60 minutes".
# 3. Set `variable_storage_mode` to "on".
