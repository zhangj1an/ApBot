# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance features for the user command, "Activate the washer and begin a 60-minute auto cycle, ensuring it is stored post-operation."
# According to the user manual:
# 1. "Press this button to start a drying then sterilising cycle. Press once for 35 minutes cycle, 25 minutes drying and 10 minutes sterilising. Press twice for 60 minutes cycle, 25 minutes drying and 35 minutes sterilising."
# This aligns with the "auto_mode" feature in the feature_list.
# 2. "Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser. The steriliser will run a programme that emits 5 minutes of UV light and 5 minutes of drying every 2 hours, to ensure items inside remain sterile."
# This aligns with the "storage_function" feature in the feature_list.
# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is: "auto_mode" and "storage_function".
# The goal variable values are: set `variable_auto_mode_duration` to "60 minutes" and set `variable_storage_mode` to "on".
