# The current code is accurate and correctly models the necessary features to achieve the given user command: 
# "Power on the bottle warmer and use the slow warm function for an 8 oz glass bottle of room temperature milk. Set the slow warm setting to HI."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Use the "turn_on_off_appliance" feature to power on the appliance.
# 2. Use the "set_and_adjust_menu" feature to navigate to the "Slow" menu option and adjust the slow warm setting to "HI."

# Relevant user manual text:
# 1. "Tap the power button to shut down the appliance."
#    - Mapped to feature_list["turn_on_off_appliance"].
# 2. "Tap the menu button until the 'slow' function is selected."
#    - Mapped to feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"].
# 3. "If any of the bottles have 7 oz of milk or more...use the +/- keys to select the HI setting."
#    - Mapped to feature_list["set_and_adjust_menu"] for variable_menu_setting_slow.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_menu_index to "Slow".
# - Set variable_menu_setting_slow to "HI".
