# The current code already models the relevant appliance functionality accurately, making it capable of achieving the requested user command.
# Below is the analysis based on the user command and the provided code:

# User Command:
# Turn on the microwave oven to bake cookies. Set the temperature to 150°C, 
# function dial to 'Convection', selector dial to 'Top & Bottom Heating', and timer to '20'.

# Sequence of features required:
# 1. Adjust temperature dial to 150°C: Achieved via "general_cooking" feature, step 1.
# 2. Adjust function dial to "Convection": Achieved via "general_cooking" feature, step 2.
# 3. Adjust selector dial to "Top & Bottom Heating": Achieved via "general_cooking" feature, step 3.
# 4. Adjust timer to "20 minutes": Achieved via "general_cooking" feature, step 4.

# Relevant User Manual Text:
# ---
# "1. Plug the power cable to the electric mains and switch it ON."

# Relevant feature list in the code:
# "feature_list['general_cooking']" models the step-by-step procedure to set temperature, function mode, selector mode, and timer.

# Goal variable values:
# variable_temperature_dial = "150°C"
# variable_function_dial = "Convection"
# variable_selector_dial = "Top & Bottom Heating"
# variable_timer_dial = "20 minutes"
