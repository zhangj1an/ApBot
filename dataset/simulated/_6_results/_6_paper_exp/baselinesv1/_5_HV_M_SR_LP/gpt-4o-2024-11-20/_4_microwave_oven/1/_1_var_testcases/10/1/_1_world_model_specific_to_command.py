#  4. Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start defrosting. The remaining cooking time will be displayed."
# Corresponding feature_list entry: `feature_list["time_defrost"]`.

# 2. Relevant feature from the user manual: **5. SPEEDY COOKING**
# "2. In waiting state, instant cooking at 100% power level with 30 seconds' cooking time can be started by pressing 'START/+30SEC'. Each press on the same button will increase cooking time by 30 seconds. The maximum cooking time is 99 minutes and 99 seconds."
