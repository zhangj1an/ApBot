# The current code correctly models the required features to achieve the command "Defrost using time defrost for 15 minutes with 30% power, then start the appliance."
# Below is the sequence of features and their corresponding steps/actions from the given code to accomplish the command:

# Step 1: Use the "time_defrost" feature to set the defrost time and power.
# - Feature: "time_defrost"
#   1) Press "press_time_defrost_button" to activate the time defrost setting. 
#   2) Set "variable_time_defrost" to "00:15:00" using meta_actions_on_numbers. 
#      - User manual excerpt: "**7. TIME DEFROST FUNCTION** - Press number pads to input defrosting time. The effective time range is 00:01~99:99".
#   3) Press "press_power_button" to adjust the power setting.
#   4) Set "variable_power" to "PL3" (30% power) using meta_actions_on_numbers.
#   5) Press "press_start_plus_30sec_button" to start the time defrost feature.

# Step 2: Start the appliance:
# - The appliance will automatically start upon completing the above steps, as "press_start_plus_30sec_button" also starts the operation in the "time_defrost" feature.

# The feature_list and required variables already support this process.
# Goal variable values to achieve the command are:
# - variable_time_defrost = "00:15:00"
# - variable_power = "PL3"
# - variable_start_running = "on" (achieved during execution of "press_start_plus_30sec_button").
