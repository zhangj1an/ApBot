# Based on the user manual text and the provided code implementation, 
# the features and actions seem well modeled to address the user command: "Turn on the microwave oven to grill vegetables.
# Set the temperature to 200°C, function dial to 'Convection', selector dial to 'Top Heating', and timer to '30'."

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Use the "general_cooking" feature to set:
#    - Temperature dial to "200°C"
#    - Function dial to "Convection"
#    - Selector dial to "Top Heating"
#    - Timer dial to "30 minutes"

# Raw user manual text relevant to this operation:
# - General Cooking Use: "Turn the Temperature dial clockwise to the desired cooking temperature."
# - General Cooking Use: "Turn the Function dial clockwise to the desired operation."
# - General Cooking Use: "Turn the Selector dial clockwise to select top heating, bottom heating, or both."
# - General Cooking Use: "Turn the Timer dial clockwise to the desired cooking duration. Heating will commence immediately."

# Feature list name in the given code:
# - "general_cooking"

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_temperature_dial = "200°C"
# - variable_function_dial = "Convection"
# - variable_selector_dial = "Top Heating"
# - variable_timer_dial = "30 minutes"
