# The current code does not include the necessary feature and variable to start the dehumidifier (or air purifier, based on the user manual) operation. 
# According to the user manual:
# "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# This explicitly suggests a variable_power_on_off should be used to initiate operation. It is correctly modeled.

# The code also correctly models the fan speed: 
# User manual: "Press the (fan speed) FAN SPEED button repeatedly until the desired speed is illuminated on the control panel. There are 4 fan speeds: Low, Medium, High and Turbo."

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# - Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn on the appliance.
# - Use the "adjust_fan_speed" feature to set the fan speed to "medium."

# Relevant feature_list names: 
# - "power_on_off"
# - "adjust_fan_speed"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_fan_speed to "medium".
