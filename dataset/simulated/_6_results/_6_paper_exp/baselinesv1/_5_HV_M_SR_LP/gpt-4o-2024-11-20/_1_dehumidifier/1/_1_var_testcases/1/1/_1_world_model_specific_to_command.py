# For the given user command "Turn on the dehumidifier and set the humidity to 50%":
# The current code already correctly models the necessary appliance features for achieving this command.

# User manual mentions:
# "Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation." This is modeled as:
# feature_list["power_on_off"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]

# User manual mentions:
# "Humidity can be set in Auto mode, with the setup range: 40%-45%-50%-55%-60%-65%-70%." This is modeled as:
# feature_list["adjust_humidity"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_humidity_button"], "variable": "variable_humidity_level"}]

# The sequence of features needed for the command:
# 1. "power_on_off" to turn on the dehumidifier.
# 2. "adjust_humidity" to set the humidity level to 50%.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_humidity_level to 50.
