# User command: Switch on the dehumidifier and configure the timer to shut down after 3 hours.

# Verifying the current code against the user manual:
# The current code correctly models the "power_on_off" feature to turn on the dehumidifier using "press_power_button". 
# For the "adjust_timer" feature, the user manual describes that the timer can be adjusted, but the feature already models the adjustment in hours incrementally (step size = 1). 
# Thus, both features are correctly implemented in the provided code.

# Sequence of the features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. "power_on_off": Switch on the dehumidifier by pressing the power button (sets variable_power_on_off to "on").
# 2. "adjust_timer": Configure the timer to 3 hours using the timer button (sets variable_timer to 3 hours).

# Relevant user manual text:
# 1. "Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation."
# 2. "In standby state touch TIMER slightly, 88 on LCD will flicker, and slightly touch TIMER to adjust time, every one touch increases one hour... after the set time expires, the dehumidifier automatically starts."

# Relevant feature list in the given code:
# 1. feature_list["power_on_off"]
# 2. feature_list["adjust_timer"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# 2. Set variable_timer to "3".
