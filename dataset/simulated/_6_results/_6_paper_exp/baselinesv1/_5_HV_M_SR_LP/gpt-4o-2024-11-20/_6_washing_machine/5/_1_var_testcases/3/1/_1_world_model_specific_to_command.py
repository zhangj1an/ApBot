# The current code correctly models the features described in the user manual to achieve the requested user command.
# Here is the sequence of features and variables required:

# 1. Switch on the washing machine:
#    Feature: "on_off"
#    User manual: "Product is switched On or Off."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["on_off"]

# 2. Select 'Mixed' program:
#    Feature: "set_program"
#    User manual: "Available according to the laundry type."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["set_program"]

# 3. Select 'Low' water level:
#    Feature: "set_water_level"
#    User manual: "Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["set_water_level"]

# 4. Schedule time for 20 minutes (this feature not explicitly included in the user manual):
#    Observing the manual, the provided Time Manager has specific functions to adjust washing time incrementally. However, '20 minutes scheduling' may be inferred to map the Time Manager increments. It will use:
#    Feature: "set_time_manager"
#    User manual: "Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["set_time_manager"]

# 5. Rinse '1 Time':
#    Feature: "set_rinse_times"
#    User manual: "Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["set_rinse_times"]

# 6. Spin for 'Long':
#    Feature: "set_spin_speed"
#    User manual: "Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
#    Feature List Name: feature_list["set_spin_speed"]

# Goal variable values for the requested command:
# - variable_on_off: "on"
# - variable_program: "Mixed"
# - variable_water_level: "Low"
# - variable_time_manager: "3" (assumed to correlate with approximate 20 minutes if increments are not specified)
# - variable_rinse_times: "1 time"
# - variable_spin_speed: "Medium" or "Long" depending on additional clarification in manual.
