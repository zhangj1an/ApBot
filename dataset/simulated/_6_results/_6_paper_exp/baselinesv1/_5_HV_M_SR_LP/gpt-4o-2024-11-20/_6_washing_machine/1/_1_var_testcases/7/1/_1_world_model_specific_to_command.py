# The current implementation accurately models the requested sequence of features to achieve the user command as described in the user manual.

# Here is the sequence of features and variable values needed to achieve the command:

# User command sequence:
# 1. Power on the washing machine. (Feature: "power_adjust")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
#    - Feature: "power_adjust"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_power_on_off to "on".

# 2. Select the "Super Eco Wash" cycle using the cycle selector dial. (Feature: "adjust_cycle_selector")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
#    - Feature: "adjust_cycle_selector"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_cycle_selector to "Super Eco Wash".

# 3. Adjust the temperature to "Cold water". (Feature: "adjust_temperature")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 95 °C."
#    - Feature: "adjust_temperature"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_temperature to "Cold water".

# 4. Adjust the spin speed to "800". (Feature: "adjust_spin_speed")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
#    - Feature: "adjust_spin_speed"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_spin_speed to "800".

# 5. Set the "Soak + Rinse+" option. (Feature: "adjust_options")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak, Intensive, Prewash, Rinse+, Soak + Rinse+, Intensive + Rinse+, Prewash + Rinse+, Off."
#    - Feature: "adjust_options"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_option to "Soak + Rinse+".

# 6. Set Delay End to "5" hours. (Feature: "adjust_delay_end")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
#    - Feature: "adjust_delay_end"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_delay_end to 5.

# 7. Start the machine. (Feature: "start_pause_cycle")
#    - Raw User Manual: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."
#    - Feature: "start_pause_cycle"
#    - Goal Variable: Set variable_start_running to "on".

# Final Goal Variable Values:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_cycle_selector = "Super Eco Wash"
# variable_temperature = "Cold water"
# variable_spin_speed = "800"
# variable_option = "Soak + Rinse+"
# variable_delay_end = 5
# variable_start_running = "on"
