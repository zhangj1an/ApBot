# The current code accurately models the described appliance features based on the user manual. Below is the sequence of features needed to achieve the requested user command:

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. Use the feature `on_off` to turn the appliance on.
# 2. Use the feature `set_program` to set the program to "Quick Wash".
# 3. Use the feature `set_water_level` to set water level to "Low".
#    Note: Raw user manual text refers to **Water Level**: Select water level according to clothing categories.
#    The current code defines the range of water levels as ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"]. As "Low" isn't explicitly available,
#    we assume the user intends this to refer to "1". You can clarify based on additional user insights.
# 4. Use the feature `set_time_manager` to select the washing time to "15 minutes".
# 5. Use the feature `set_rinse_times` to set rinse to "2 Times".
# 6. Use the feature `set_spin_speed` to configure spinning speed to "Regular".
# 7. Use the feature `start_pause_operation` to begin operation.

# Raw User Manual References:
# - **1 On/Off button**: Product is switched On or Off.
# - **Program**: Set programs like "Quick Wash".
# - **Water Level**: Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling, and washing habits.
# - **Time Manager**: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time, and other settings can be selectable.
# - **Rinse**: Multiple rinse options available.
# - **Spin**: Different spin speed configurations provided.
# - **2 Start/Pause button**: Press the button to start or pause the washing cycle.

# The goal variable values to achieve the user command are:
# - Turn on the machine: `variable_on_off` = "on".
# - Set program to "Quick Wash": `variable_program` = "Quick Wash".
# - Set water level to "1" (assuming "Low" corresponds to the minimum level): `variable_water_level` = "1".
# - Set time to "15 minutes": `variable_time_manager` = "4" (corresponding value from user-selected range).
# - Set rinse times to "2 Times": `variable_rinse_times` = "2 times".
# - Set spin speed to "Regular": `variable_spin_speed` = "Medium".
# - Start operation: `variable_start_running` = "on".
