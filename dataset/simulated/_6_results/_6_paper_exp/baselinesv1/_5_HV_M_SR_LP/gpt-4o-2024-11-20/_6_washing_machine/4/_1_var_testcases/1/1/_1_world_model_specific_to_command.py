# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance feature for the requested user command. 
# The features in the feature_list provided are sufficient to achieve the user command following the user manual instructions.

# According to the user manual:
# 1. **Turn on the washing machine:** This can be modeled using the `power_on_off` feature.
# 2. **Select the 'Powerful' program:** Use `adjust_program` feature.
# 3. **Set washing time to 18 minutes:** Use `adjust_wash_time` feature.
# 4. **Set water level to 59L:** Use `adjust_water_level` feature.
# 5. **Set spin time to 9 minutes:** Use `adjust_spin_time` feature.
# 6. **Set rinse to 'Water-Injection Rinse 2 times':** Use `adjust_rinse_type` feature.
# 7. **Start the machine running:** Use `start_pause` feature.

# The required sequence of features includes the following:
# - `power_on_off` (to turn the washing machine on)
# - `adjust_program` (to select the program as 'Powerful')
# - `adjust_wash_time` (to set wash time to 18 minutes)
# - `adjust_water_level` (to set water level to 59L)
# - `adjust_spin_time` (to set spin time to 9 minutes)
# - `adjust_rinse_type` (to set rinse to 'Water-Injection Rinse 2 times')
# - `start_pause` (to start the machine running)

# Goal variable values based on the user command:
# - `variable_power_on_off` should be set to "on".
# - `variable_program` should be set to "P2 (Powerful)".
# - `variable_washing_time` should be set to 18.
# - `variable_water_level` should be set to 59.
# - `variable_spin_time` should be set to 9.
# - `variable_rinse_type` should be set to "Water-Injection Rinse 2 times".
# - `variable_start_running` should be set to "start".

# No modifications to the existing feature_list or Simulator class are required as the current implementation already supports fulfilling the user command.
