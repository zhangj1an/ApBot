# The code includes the required features to achieve the user command. Here's the sequence of features and the goal variable values for the command:

# **Features needed to accomplish the command:**
# 1. "toggle_power" (Switch the washing machine on)
#    - Raw user manual text: Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press “Start/Pause” within 10 minutes after power-on.
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "toggle_power"
#
# 2. "select_program" (Use the Normal program)
#    - Raw user manual text: Programs - Variety of Programs - Allows selection from Normal, Delicate, Baby-care, etc.
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "select_program"
#
# 3. "adjust_water_level" (Set the water level to 32 L)
#    - Raw user manual text: Change Water Level - During the wash process, press “Water Level” to change the water level.
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "adjust_water_level"
#
# 4. "adjust_preset_timer" (Finish in 3 hours)
#    - Raw user manual text: Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours).
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "adjust_preset_timer"
#
# 5. "start_operation" (Start the appliance)
#    - Raw user manual text: Start/Pause button starts the operation.
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "start_operation"
#
# 6. "set_child_lock" (Activate child lock)
#    - Raw user manual text: Setting Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, if the lid is opened while the washing machine is operating, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed.
#    - Corresponding feature_list name: "set_child_lock"

# **Goal variable values:**
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_program_selection`: "1 Normal"
# - `variable_water_level`: "32 L"
# - `variable_preset_timer`: 3
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
# - `variable_child_lock`: "on"

# Since the current code already models all the required features accurately and there are no missing features, here is the ExtendedSimulator(Simulator) implementation without changes:
