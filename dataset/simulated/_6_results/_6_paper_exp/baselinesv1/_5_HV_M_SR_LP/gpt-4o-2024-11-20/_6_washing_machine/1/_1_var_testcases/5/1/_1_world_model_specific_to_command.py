# Python comments explaining the sequence of features and raw user manual references

# The current code models the appliance correctly based on the user manual.
# To achieve the user command "Power on a daily wash for everyday cotton items, using Daily Wash cycle, 
# 40°C temperature, 1200 rpm spin speed, Intensive option, set delay to 5 hours, and start the machine.", 
# we will use the following sequence of features:

# 1. "power_adjust" to turn the machine on.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
# 2. "adjust_cycle_selector" to set the wash cycle to "Daily Wash".
#    Relevant user manual text: "Cycle Selector: Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
# 3. "adjust_temperature" to set the temperature to 40°C.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Temp. button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 95 °C."
# 4. "adjust_spin_speed" to set the spin speed to 1200 rpm.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Spin button: Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
# 5. "adjust_options" to set the washing option to "Intensive".
#    Relevant user manual text: "Option button: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options. Available options: Soak, Intensive, Prewash, Rinse+, Soak + Rinse+, Intensive + Rinse+, Prewash + Rinse+, Off."
# 6. "adjust_delay_end" to set the delay end to 5 hours.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Delay End: Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
# 7. "start_pause_cycle" to start the machine.
#    Relevant user manual text: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."

# Feature List Names in Code:
# - "power_adjust"
# - "adjust_cycle_selector"
# - "adjust_temperature"
# - "adjust_spin_speed"
# - "adjust_options"
# - "adjust_delay_end"
# - "start_pause_cycle"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_power_on_off: "on"
# - variable_cycle_selector: "Daily Wash"
# - variable_temperature: "40°C"
# - variable_spin_speed: "1200"
# - variable_option: "Intensive"
# - variable_delay_end: 5
# - variable_start_running: "on"
