# The current code already models the requested user command accurately. 
# To achieve the command, the following sequence of features is required:

# 1. Activate the washer by toggling the on/off state:
# Feature: "on_off"
# User Manual: **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.

# 2. Run the 'Mixed' program:
# Feature: "set_program"
# User Manual: **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.

# 3. Set 'Low' water level:
# Feature: "set_water_level"
# User Manual: **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.

# 4. Adjust Time Manager to 35 minutes (we use closest applicable step since discrete value ranges do not support 35 directly):
# Feature: "set_time_manager"
# User Manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.

# 5. Set rinse to '2 Times':
# Feature: "set_rinse_times"
# User Manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.

# 6. Set spin speed to 'Short':
# Feature: "set_spin_speed"
# User Manual: It's listed under control panel symbols as available options in spin speed choices.

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# - variable_on_off = "on"
# - variable_program = "Mixed"
# - variable_water_level = "2"
# - variable_time_manager = "3" (closest option for 35 minutes)
# - variable_rinse_times = "2 times"
# - variable_spin_speed = "Low"
