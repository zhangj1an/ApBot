Below is the relevant part of the user manual that can help a human operate the washing machine to achieve the goal:\n\n---\n\n**Doing laundry using the Cycle Selector**\n\nYour new washing machine makes washing laundry easy, using Samsung\u2019s automatic control system \u201cFuzzy Control\u201d. When you select a wash cycle, the machine will set the correct temperature, washing time, and washing speed.\n\n1. Turn the water supply on.  \n2. Press the **Power** button to turn the power on.  \n3. Open the door.  \n4. Add your laundry loosely into the drum without overfilling it.  \n5. Close the door.  \n6. Add detergent, and if necessary, softener or prewash detergent into the appropriate compartments in the detergent drawer.  \n7. Use the **Cycle Selector** to select the appropriate cycle according to the type of material: **Outdoor Care**. The relevant indicators will light up on the control panel.  \n8. At this time, you can control the wash temperature, the number of rinse cycles, the spinning speed, and the delay time by pressing the appropriate buttons:  \n   - Press the **Temp.** button to set the temperature to **40 \u00b0C**.  \n   - Press the **Spin** button to set the spin speed to **1200 rpm**.  \n   - Press the **Option** button repeatedly to select **Soak + Rinse+**.  \n   - Press the **Delay End** button repeatedly to set the delay to **5 hours**.  \n9. Press the **Start/Pause** button to start the wash. The progress indicator will light up, and the remaining time for the cycle will appear on the display.  \n\n   **[Info]** Both the total cycle time and the number of rinse cycles in the Cotton cycle may vary depending on the amount of laundry.  \n\n10. After the total cycle has finished, the power will turn off automatically. Open the door and remove the laundry.  \n\n---\n\nThis section provides the necessary steps to achieve the desired washing settings.\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
