Set washing time to 18 minutes, with 30 L of water, and spin for 3 minutes only. Set rinse type to 'Normal Rinse 2 times', then start the machine running.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**How to Use the Washing Machine**\n\n**Partial Operations Using the Fuzzy Program**\n\n- Repeatedly press the Water Level, Wash, Rinse, Spin buttons until the water level, wash, rinse, and spin settings you want are set. If the indicator is not lit, that operation is not performed.\n\n- You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L.\n\n  | Water Level |\n  |-------------|\n  | 59 L        |\n  | 50 L        |\n  | 40 L        |\n  | 35 L        |\n  | 30 L        |\n  | 25 L (Auto) |\n\n  SF-80XB/SF-75XB\n\n- You can set the wash time each time you press the Wash button in a range from 3 to 18 minutes and no washing.\n\n  | Wash Time  |\n  |------------|\n  | 18 Min     |\n  | 15 Min     |\n  | 12 Min     |\n  | 9 Min      |\n  | 6 Min      |\n  | 3 Min      |\n  | No washing |\n\n- You can set the number and type of rinses by pressing the Rinse button. Each time you press the Rinse button the setting changes in sequence, from Normal Rinse 2 times, Water-Injection Rinse 2 times, no rinsing, Normal Rinse 1 time, Water-Injection Rinse 1 time.\n\n  | Rinse Type         |\n  |--------------------|\n  | EX 2               |\n  | 2                  |\n  | EX 1               |\n  | 1                  |\n  | No rinsing         |\n\n- You can set the spin time each time you press the Spin button in a range of 1 to 9 minutes and no spinning.\n\n  | Spin Time  |\n  |------------|\n  | 9 Min      |\n  | 6 Min      |\n  | 3 Min      |\n  | 1 Min      |\n  | No setup   |\n\nPage 20\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
