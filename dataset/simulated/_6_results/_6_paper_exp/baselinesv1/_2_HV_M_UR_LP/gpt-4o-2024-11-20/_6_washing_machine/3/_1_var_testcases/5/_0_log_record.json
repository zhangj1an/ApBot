(P. 12)\n- Turn on the water faucet.\n\n- Operation panel of NA-F80VB7\n\n| Symbol | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 1      | Normal      |\n| 2      | Delicate    |\n| 3      | Baby Care   |\n| 7      | Fragrance   |\n| 9      | Blanket     |\n| 2      | Soak        |\n| 6      | Speedy      |\n| 8      | Water Save  |\n| 5      | Air Dry (90 min) |\n| 8      | Tub Hygiene |\n\n- Power: On/Off\n- Start/Pause (Press 3 seconds)\n\n**1. After loading laundry**\n\n**Turn the power on.**\n\n**2. Select a program. (P. 5)**\n\n- Program\n- e.g.) 1 Normal program\n- Timer preset\n\n**3. Start.**\n\n- Start/Pause\n- The pulsator moves without water and measures the amount of laundry (approx. 5 seconds).\n\n**Water level indication** (approx. 5 seconds)\n\n**Water begins to be supplied.**\n\n- Remaining time indication\n  - To check the water level \u2192 Press \u201cWater Level\u201d.\n  - To check the program \u2192 Press \u201cProgram\u201d.\n\n**4. According to the water level indication**\n\n**Put in detergent.**\n\n**5. Close the lid.**\n\n- Operation ends with beeps.\n\n**Set how many hours later to finish operation. (P. 4)**\n\n- Preset (Hours)\n  - 2 minutes after start-up, all indications except \u201cPreset\u201d turn off.\n  - To confirm after the timer has been set, press \u201cPreset\u201d.\n  - To cancel or change, press \u201cOn/Off\u201d.\n  - The hours that can be set differ depending on the program.\n\n**When the 4 Fragrance program is selected**\n\n- The buzzer sounds before the final rinse and operation is paused. Put the desired amount of softener which has been diluted with water directly into the tub.\n\n  - If the lid is left closed, the buzzer sounds every 10 minutes for up to 1 hour.\n  - If the lid is left closed for more than 1 hour, operation resumes.\n  - The 4 Fragrance program cannot be selected when Child Lock (P. 10) is set.\n\n**After pressing \u201cStart\u201d**\n\n- You can change the water level until the end of the wash process.\n- You cannot change the program.\n```\n\n```\n**Blanket**\n\n- Washable blankets\n  - Material: 100% synthetic fibre or 100% cotton\n  - Weight: 4.2 kg or less\n  - Blankets with a machine-washable tag attached\n\n- Put a blanket in the net and load it in the tub.\n\nRoll\n\nThe zipper part should face up. (To prevent damage to the net)\n\n**NOTE**\n\n- Use liquid detergent.\n- The water level indication shows the maximum and cannot be changed.\n```\n\n```\n**Convenient Functions**\n\nSetting Child Lock\n\nTo prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, if the lid is opened while the washing machine is operating, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed. Not closing it within 10 seconds flushes the water out.\n- This function does not lock the lid and button operations.\n- When water is drained forcibly, \u201cU 99\u201d is displayed. (P. 15)\n\n1 After closing the lid On/Off Turn the power on.\n\n2 Program Press and hold for 5 seconds. (2 short beeps) (Press 5 seconds) (4 short beeps)\n\n- To cancel, do the same procedure.\n```\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
