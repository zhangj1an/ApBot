Power On/Off**\n\nConnect power plug to the power supply. The display screen illuminates with ... ... , indicating the unit is on standby mode, ready to be switched on anytime. Press the \u23fb button to turn on/off the unit.\n\n- \ud83d\udd35 Air outlet flap automatically opens when the unit is turned on, and automatically closes when the unit is turned off.\n- \ud83d\udd35 User may adjust the air outlet flap position by using the remote control oscillation function.\n- \ud83d\udd35 Unit is programmed to operate based on the last preceding setting.\n- \ud83d\udd35 Press the \u23fb button once again to turn off the unit. Always wait for a few minutes before removing the power plug from the power supply. This is to allow the unit to perform a cycle of checks to verify operation.\n- \ud83d\udd35 DO NOT force open or close the air outlet oscillating flap to prevent damage to the oscillation mechanism.\n\n---\n\n**02. Cool Mode**\n\nPress the \ud83d\udd04 button consecutively to select \u25a0 COOL. Press the \u2b07 or \u2b06 button to select the preferred temperature from 18\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C and desired fan speed (High, Medium, Low or Auto) by pressing the \ud83d\udd04 button.\n\nUnder Cool Mode, unit is programmed to work in accordance to the temperature difference between the surrounding and desired temperature setting when auto fan speed is selected.\n\n| TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE                          | OPERATING MODE | FAN SPEED SETTING                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Surrounding Temperature > Desired Temperature Setting | Cool Mode      | Temp.

We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
