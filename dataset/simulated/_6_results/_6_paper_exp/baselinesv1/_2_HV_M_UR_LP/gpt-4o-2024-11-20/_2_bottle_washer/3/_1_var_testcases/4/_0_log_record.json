                    "context_prompt": "The list of available actions of the appliance is: \n\npress_wash_mode_button  \npress_sterilize_dry_button  \npress_and_hold_wash_mode_button (duration = 5 seconds)  \npress_and_hold_wash_mode_button_and_sterilize_dry_button (duration = 3 seconds)  \npress_and_hold_power_button (duration = 3 seconds)  \npress_start_pause_button  \n\nThe user command is:\n\nPlease activate the bottle washer and run the 'Sterilize & Dry' cycle, and press start to begin.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**Starting a Sterilize and Dry Only Mode Without Washing**\n\n![Sterilize & Dry: 69:00]  \n**Sterilize & Dry:** Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 1 time, then press the Start/Pause button to start.\n\n![Dry Only: 60:00]  \n**Dry Only:** Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 2 times, then press the Start/Pause button to start.\n\n![Sterilize Only: 9:00]  \n**Sterilize Only:** Touch the Sterilize-Dry button 3 times, then press the Start/Pause button to start.\n\nThe Bottle Washer Pro\u00ae will shut-off automatically after finishing the Sterilize and Dry cycles.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f The Bottle Washer Pro\u00ae uses HOT WATER, STEAM & HOT AIR to wash, sterilize & dry bottles and accessories. USE CAUTION when handling bottles after washing, sterilizing and/or drying.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
