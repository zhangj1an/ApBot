Place the appliance on a flat surface where it is out of reach of children and it will not be knocked or moved during operation.\n2. Remove the lid, baskets and accessory rack from the sterilizer base.\n3. Pour water on the base/heater surface to MAX line (165ml/5.5oz).  \n   Never fill past MAX line. We recommend using distilled water to avoid mineral scale build-up on the heating plate. However, you can use bottled water or tap water but you may need to descale more frequently.\n4. Place the lower basket on the base.\n5. Place clean bottles with their opening facing downward on the bottle posts.\n6. Place the accessory tray in the lower basket (tray not for use with tall bottles).\n7. Place bottle accessories on the accessory rack (nipples, collars, caps, etc).\n8. Place the upper basket on top of the lower basket, ensuring that it fits securely without any gaps.\n9. Place breast pump parts or more accessories in the upper basket.\n10. Press the On/Off (power symbol) button once and the function icons will light up.  \n    Choose your desired function following the instructions below.  \n    If there is no selection of function after pressing on/off button, the appliance will automatically switch off.\n\nAutomatic Sterilize/Dry Function:\n1. Choose the drying time (after steam sterilization): Press the Sterilize/Dry (steam and dry symbol) button 1 time for 30 minute dry time, 2 times for 45 minute dry time, 3 times for 60 minute dry time. The sterilize/dry cycle will start 3 seconds after the last button press.\n2. When the sterilization cycle starts, the timer will count up second-by-second for the duration of the sterilization cycle.\n3. When the sterilization cycle is complete, the appliance will beep, pause for 3 seconds and begin the drying cycle for the amount of time selected in step 1. The timer on the timer will count down second-by-second until it reaches 00:00.\n4. When the drying cycle is completed, the appliance will beep 5 times and switch off automatically.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
