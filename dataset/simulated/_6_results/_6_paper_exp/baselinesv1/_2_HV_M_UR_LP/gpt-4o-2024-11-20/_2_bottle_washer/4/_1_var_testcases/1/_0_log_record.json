                    "context_prompt": "The list of available actions of the appliance is: \n\npress_power_button  \npress_and_hold_power_button  \npress_menu_button  \npress_and_hold_menu_button  \npress_plus_button  \npress_and_hold_plus_button  \npress_minus_button  \npress_and_hold_minus_button  \n\nThe user command is:\n\nTurn on the bottle warmer and set the quick warm function for a glass bottle with 2 oz of refrigerated milk. Adjust the time to 3 minutes.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n**QUICK WARM FUNCTION:**\n\n*The function uses steam to warm the bottle as fast as possible.*\n\n1. Put 100 ml (3.5 oz) of water inside the warmer  \n2. Tap the power button.  \n   All options will appear on the screen.  \n3. Tap the menu button until the \u201cquick\u201d function is selected.  \n   The 3 minute default time will appear on the display screen.  \n   To adjust the time use the +/- to add or decrease the time.  \n4. After a few seconds the quick warm function will begin. The display screen will show the remaining time.  \n5. When the timer bell rings the quick warm function is complete.  \n\n*Warning: While the appliance is in use hot steam will escape from the cover vent - be careful!*  \n\n6. Tap the power button to shut down the appliance. Use the tongs provided to remove the hot utensils.  \n\n*Warning: When lifting the cover hot steam will escape - be careful!*  \n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
