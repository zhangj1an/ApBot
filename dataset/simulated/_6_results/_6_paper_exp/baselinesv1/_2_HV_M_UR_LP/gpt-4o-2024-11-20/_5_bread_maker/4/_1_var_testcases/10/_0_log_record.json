Use the french menu and initiate a 3-hour delay. Use gluten-free setting. Please ensure the appliance starts.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**BREAD MAKING**\n\n1. Follow steps 1 to 7 on page 9 to set up the bread maker.\n2. Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen.\n3. To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark (and Rapid) on the display screen.\n4. To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen.\n5. Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program.\n\n**TIME DELAY**\n\n1. If desired, press the TIMER button to change the start time on the bread maker.\n2. The time displayed represents the finishing time. For example, if you adjust the Basic Bread default time 3:25 to 5:00, the bread will be finished at the end of 5 hours. The time can be delayed by up to 15 hours.\n3. Press up arrow to increase the time in 10 minute increments or press down arrow to decrease the time in 10 minute increments.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe Crust Colour, Loaf Size and Timer can only be adjusted on AUTO MENU selections 1-4. Selection 8 allows for the timer to be adjusted only. All other auto menu selections operate as per their default setting. See AUTO MENU Default Table on page 9.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf the Timer is activated, the kneading blade will not mix the ingredients until the cycle is set to begin. For example, for Basic Bread the default time to complete the program is 3:25. If the delayed time is changed to 5:00, the cycle will not start for 1 hour 35 minutes after pressing START.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nPress START/CANCEL to start a selected MENU program.\n\n**GLUTEN FREE**\n\n1. Press the GLUTEN FREE button on the control panel. GLUTEN FREE will display on the screen.\n2. Press the START/CANCEL button to commence.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nGluten Free can also be selected by pressing MENU until GLUTEN FREE setting 10 is displayed on the screen.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
