Select the Quick program. Choose a loaf size of 900g. Set the crust color to Medium. Set the delay timer to 2 hours. Power on and start operation.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**Start Baking**\n\n1. The control panel display will light up and will sound a long beep. The appliance will automatically be set to the BASIC programme with the crust setting at MEDIUM. The display will show 3:00.\n2. Choose a Programme with the MENU button.\n3. Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed).\n4. Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed).\n5. Press START/STOP button to start the breadmaker.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nDuring the baking process, the main body and the lid will get hot. Be careful not to burn yourself.  \nTo cancel during a process, press and hold the START/STOP button until the breadmaker sounds once.\n- Only as do this in an emergency, as the breadmaker will reset to the beginning of its program. You must then begin again as the ingredients may be ruined and need replacing.\n- Only press this button after you have selected the Menu Program, Crust Colour (and Delay Time if required). Otherwise, it will not reset.\n\nWhen the breadmaker is operating, only open the lid at the prescribed places in the baking cycle. Failure to observe this will affect the quality of the bread, especially its ability to rise properly.\n\n**Setting the Delay Timer**\n\nThe time delay function allows you to delay the start time of baking by up to 12 hours, depending on the length of the baking cycle.\n\nFor example: It is 8:00p.m. and you want to have fresh bread (using the Basic setting) at 7:00a.m.\n\nThe the difference between now (8:00p.m.) and 7:00a.m. is 11 hours. Connect the breadmaker to the mains socket. The preset cycle of 3:00 hours will be displayed.\n\n| Steps                                                                 | Display / Button          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Set the display time to 11:00 (The time difference between now and   | Up arrow, down arrow      |\n| when you want the bread).                                            | 1 11:00                   |\n| Press to add time in 10 minutes steps.                               | TIME +                    |\n| Press to deduct time in 10 minutes steps.                            | TIME -                    |\n| Press the START/STOP button to start time delayed baking.            | START/STOP                |\n\nIf you keep the TIME+ or TIME- buttons pressed, they will cycle to a maximum of 13:00 hours and reset to the preset programme time (in this case 3:00 hours).\n\nThe timer display shows the total time left (in hours and minutes) until the bread is finished (including the delay added and the programme time). It does not display the 1 hour KEEP WARM time after the programme is finished.\n\nRemember to press the START/STOP button to commence the timer countdown - otherwise nothing will happen. If you set the timer incorrectly after the START/STOP button has been pressed, you are able to switch off and reset the delay period again only if mixing has not started.\n\n**Programme Menu**\n\nThe breadmaker has a choice of 12 Programmes. Press the MENU button repeatedly to cycle through the options below.\n\n| Programme      | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 4.

The breadmaker stirs once and then bakes the dough. Place liquids in the bottom of the bread pan, dry ingredients on top. During the initial mixing, dry ingredients may collect in the corners of the pan. You may need to clear the corners with a plastic spatula to avoid flour lumps. |\n\n**Other Functional Buttons**\n\n| Other Functional Buttons | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| COLOR button (for Crust Control) | \u2022 Programmes 1-7 offer 3 degrees of crust which you can select repeatedly by pressing the COLOR button. You can choose Medium, Dark or Light crust. <br> \u2022 Crust control is not appropriate for the other Programmes. |\n| DELAY TIMER buttons      | \u2022 The time delay function allows you to delay the start time of the baking by up to 12 hours, depending on the length of the baking cycle. <br> \u2022 All programmes can be combined with the time delay function. <br> \u2022 If the dough contains fresh milk, fruit or onions, do not select the time delay function, but bake the dough immediately. <br> \u2022 We also suggest that you DO NOT use this function with the CAKE programme. |\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
