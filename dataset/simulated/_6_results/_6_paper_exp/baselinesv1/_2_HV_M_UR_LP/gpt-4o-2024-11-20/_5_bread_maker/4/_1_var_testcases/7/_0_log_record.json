Check for any missing or damaged parts. Clean all parts according to the Care, Cleaning & Storage section in this book.\n\nOPERATING YOUR BREVILLE BREAD MAKER\n\n1. Open the lid of the bread maker and remove the bread pan using the handle.\n\n2. If required, align the semi-circle on the top of the kneading blade to the one on top of the drive shaft and slide the blade down to the base of the bread pan.\n\n[Down arrow]\n\n3. Add ingredients to the bread pan in the order listed in the recipe. First add liquids, then sugar, salt, flour and add the yeast in last.\n\n[Eye symbol] NOTE\nEnsure yeast does not come into contact with sugars, salt or liquids.\n\n[Image of bread pan with layers]\nLAST\nYeast must be separate from wet ingredients\nSECOND\nDry ingredients\nFIRST\nLiquid ingredients\n\n[Eye symbol] NOTE\nIf using the delay start timer, make sure the yeast is on top of the dry ingredients to avoid being mixed with water, salt and sugar, otherwise yeast activity will be affected.\n\n4. Lock the bread pan into the base of the bread maker by twisting slightly clockwise until the bowl sits horizontal.\n\n5. Fold the handle down and close the lid.\n\n6. If required, add any fruits and/or nuts to the dispenser.\n\n[Eye symbol] NOTE\nThe bread pan is locked in place correctly if you cannot lift it from the bread maker without twisting.\n\n7. Plug the bread maker into a 220\u2013240V power outlet and switch the outlet on. The bread maker is now in standby mode and the display screen will turn on.\n\n[Eye symbol] NOTE\nIn standby, the display screen will show the first AUTO MENU selection Basic Bread, displaying MENU 1 TIMER 3:25, MEDIUM. Press the MENU button repeatedly and the bread maker will cycle through the Auto Menu choices, from 1\u201312.\n\n| Menu Selection | Menu No. | Display Screen Default Reading | Able to adjust defaults |\n|----------------|----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Basic          | 1        | 3:25 Medium 900g               | YES                     |\n| French         | 2        | 3:40 Medium 900g               | YES                     |\n| Whole Wheat    | 3        | 3:55 Medium 900g               | YES                     |\n| Sweet          | 4        | 3:27 Medium 900g               | YES                     |\n| Express 680g   | 5        | 1:20 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Express 900g   | 6        | 1:55 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Yeast Free     | 7        | 1:50 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Continental    | 8        | 3:25 N/A N/A                   | YES                     |\n| Dough          | 9        | 1:30 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Gluten Free    | 10       | 2:45 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Jam            | 11       | 1:05 N/A N/A                   | NO                      |\n| Bake           | 12       | 1:00 N/A N/A                   | YES                     |\n```\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
