Place on the work surface. It is important that the pan is filled with ingredients outside the machine so that any accidental spillage is not ignited by the heating elements.\n\n2. **Attach the blade**  \n   Attach the kneading blade to the shaft by pushing on.\n\n3. **Measure ingredients**  \n   Measure the ingredients required and add them all into the pan in the order listed. See later section \u2018Measuring your ingredients\u2019.  \n   - When adding the yeast to the baking pan, take care that the yeast does not come into contact with the water or any other liquid, as it will start to activate immediately.  \n   - Use tepid water 21-28\u00b0C.\n\n4. **Put pan back in**  \n   Place the baking pan back in the breadmaker, turning clockwise to lock into place. Close the lid.\n\n5. **Plug in**  \n   Plug into the power supply. The breadmaker will automatically be set to basic bread menu and normal time.  \n   - Every time you press a button you will hear a beep to confirm.\n\n6. **Select program**  \n   Choose the desired setting from the list by pressing the Menu button.\n\n7. **Select weight**  \n   Press Loaf size button to choose between small or large.\n\n8. **Select colour**  \n   Choose desired crust colour by pressing Colour button.\n\n9. **Select the delay time**  \n   If you wish the bread to be ready later, set the time delay now, as described in next section.\n\n10. **Start**  \n    Press the Start Stop button to start the machine. The remaining time will count down in one minute increments.\n\n11. **Progress**  \n    The breadmaker will automatically proceed through the programmed stages as shown in the \u2018Baking cycle times\u2019 section. If the breadmaker has a program selected that has a second kneading process, beeps sound to inform that fruits and/or nuts may be added.  \n    - It is possible that steam will escape through the vents during baking, this is normal.\n\n12. **Finish**  \n    When the program is completed and the bread is baked the display shows 0:00 and the beeper will sound.\n\n13. **Keep warm**  \n    The keep warm function will circulate hot air for a further 60 minutes on most settings (see \u2018Baking cycle times\u2019 section). For best results, remove the baking pan and loaf within this period or when the initial program is completed. 10 beeps will be heard when the keep warm period is finished.\n\n14. **Remove the food**  \n    Press Stop. Open the lid.  \n    **WARNING:** Use oven gloves when removing the baking pan (taking care as it is very hot).\n\n15. **Turn out the bread**  \n    Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then turn the pan upside down and tap the bread from the pan onto a rack to cool. Fill the pan with warm water immediately to prevent the blade from sticking to the shaft.  \n    - Occasionally the kneading blade will stay in the loaf. Wait until the loaf is cool and then remove the blade with a wooden or plastic utensil to avoid damage to the non-stick surface.\n\n16. **Always unplug the appliance after use.**\n\n    - Do not open the lid whilst the breadmaker is operating as this will affect the quality of the bread, especially its ability to rise properly. Only open the lid when the recipe needs you to add additional ingredients, see recipes.\n\n**Using the timer**\n\nUse the timer when you want the bread ready later, or in the morning. A maximum of 13 hours can be set. Check if function is available by consulting \u2018Baking cycle times\u2019 section. Do not use this function with recipes that use perishable ingredients such as eggs, fresh milk, sour cream, or cheese.\n\n1. Decide when you want the bread to be ready and calculate the difference in time between now and then. For example, if you want a loaf at 8am, and it is now 7.30pm, the difference is 12 1/2 hours.\n2. Enter this time by pressing \u2018Time \u25bc\u2019 and \u2018Time \u25b2\u2019 buttons. Arrows will move time up or down in 10-minute increments. After you have pressed Start, the colon (:) will flash.\n   - If you have selected the wrong time press stop for 2 seconds. The timer will go back to the program time, repeat step 1 and 2.\n3. The timer delay is up to a maximum of 13 hours. This is when the bread will be ready to remove from the machine, see page 8 item 14 \u2018Remove the food\u2019.\n\n**Control panel buttons, display & functions**\n\n**Display window**\n- Shows browning level selected\n- Shows weight selected\n- Shows the program number\n- Shows time left before completion (3:20, for example, is 3 hours and 20 minutes; 0:20 is 20 minutes)\n- Shows temperature warning - see \u2018Troubleshooting\u2019\n\n| Program Number | Program Name  |\n|----------------|---------------|\n| 1              | Basic white   |\n| 2              | French        |\n| 3              | Wholewheat    |\n| 4              | Quick         |\n| 5              | Sweet         |\n| 6              | Fastbake I    |\n| 7              | Fastbake II   |\n| 8              | Dough         |\n| 9              | Jam           |\n| 10             | Cake          |\n| 11             | Sandwich      |\n| 12             | Extrabake     |\n\n**Timer delay buttons**\nUse to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)\n\n**Start**\nPress to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts\n\n**Stop**\nPress to stop for approx 2 seconds, a beep sounds to confirm\n\n**Colour button**\nFor selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)\n\n**Menu button**\nFor choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12\n\n**Loaf size button**\nFor selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
