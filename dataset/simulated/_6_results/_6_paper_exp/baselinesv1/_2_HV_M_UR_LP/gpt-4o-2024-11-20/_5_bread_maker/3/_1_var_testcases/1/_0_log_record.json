Set the cycle to 'Basic'. Choose 'Light' crust color. Choose loaf size '2-lb'. Set the delay timer to 2 hours. Start the bread maker.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**Quick-Start Guide**\n\nSee \u201cDetailed Instructions\u201d section for additional information.\n\n1 Add Ingredients\n\n- Place kneading paddle on shaft, with arrow pointing up, pushing down as far as it will go, making sure flat surfaces are lined up.\n\n- Carefully measure and add ingredients to the bread pan in the EXACT order given in the recipe.  \n  TIP: Premeasure all ingredients, including add-ins (nuts, raisins) prior to beginning.\n\n- Place bread pan in the breadmaker, turning clockwise until it locks into place. Close cover.  \n  NOTE: Bread pan must lock into place for proper mixing and kneading.\n\nBEFORE FIRST USE: Wash and dry bread pan and kneading paddle.  \nNOTE: Do not use metal utensils in bread pan as they may damage nonstick surface.  \nCAUTION! Falling Object Hazard. Breadmaker can wobble and walk during kneading cycle. Always position it in the center of the counter away from the edge.\n\nLAST: Yeast. MUST be separate from wet ingredients  \nSECOND: Dry ingredients (sugar, salt, shortening, flour)  \nFIRST: Liquid ingredients \u2013 room temperature\n\n2 Select Cycle\n\n- Press CYCLE button until desired program number appears on the digital display.\n\n- Press CRUST and LOAF buttons to ADJUST to desired setting (not adjustable in some cycles).\n\n- To program a Delayed Start, use the Delay Timer + or \u2013 buttons to add up to 12 hours before Cycle will start. Refer to page 5 for additional information.\n\n3 Start Making Bread\n\n- Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle.\n\n- Add-ins: After the second kneading cycle, 10 beeps will signal you to add fruit, nuts, etc.\n\n- Once complete, breadmaker will beep and begin Keep Warm cycle for up to 1 hour.  \n  Press START/STOP button for 2 seconds to cancel the Keep Warm cycle and turn off breadmaker.\n\n- Using oven mitts, turn counterclockwise to unlock the bread pan, and pull bread pan straight up. Still using oven mitts, shake loaf from pan and let cool for 10 minutes.\n\n---\n\n**Control Panel**\n\n**Preprogrammed Cycles**\n\n1. Basic  \n2. French  \n3. Gluten-Free  \n4. Quick  \n5. Sweet  \n6. 1.5lb. Express  \n7. 2.0lb. Express  \n8. Dough  \n9. Jam  \n10. Cake  \n11. Whole Grain  \n12. Bake  \n\n**CYCLE**  \nPress CYCLE button to select your desired cycle. The corresponding cycle number is shown on the display.\n\n**CRUST COLOR**  \nPress CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust. (Crust is not adjustable in Cycles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.)\n\n**LOAF SIZE**  \nPress the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size. (Loaf size is not an option in Cycles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.)\n\n**DELAY TIMER**  \nUse the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time. Press the + and \u2013 buttons to increase the cycle time shown on the display. Add up to 13 hours including the delay time and breadmaking cycle.\n\n**NOTES:**  \n- Set the Delay Timer after selecting Cycle, Loaf Size, and Crust Color.  \n- The 1.5 lb. Express, 2 lb. Express, and JAM cycles do not have a delay function.  \n- Do not use the timer function with recipes that include dairy or other ingredients, such as eggs, milk, cream, or cheese.\n\n**START/STOP BUTTON**  \nPress the START/STOP button once to start a cycle. A short beep will be heard, the colon in the time display will begin to flash, and the cycle will start. To remove bread, press the START/STOP button to end the baking cycle.  \nTo cancel a cycle, press the START/STOP button for at least 2 seconds.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Instructions**\n\n**LAST:** Yeast. MUST be separate from wet ingredients\n\n**SECOND:** Dry ingredients (sugar, salt, shortening, flour)\n\n**FIRST:** Liquid ingredients \u2013 room temperature\n\n1. Using the bread pan handle, turn the bread pan counter-clockwise and then pull it out of the appliance.\n\n2. Push the kneading paddle into the drive shaft inside the bread pan.  \n   **CAUTION!** Falling Object Hazard. Breadmaker can wobble and walk during kneading cycle. Always position it in the center of the counter away from the edge.\n\n3. Add the ingredients to the bread pan in the order listed in the recipe. First, add the liquids, sugar, and salt; then the flour; and last the yeast.  \n   **NOTE:** Make sure that yeast does not come into contact with salt or liquids.\n\n4. Place the bread pan into the appliance and make sure it is firmly locked in place by turning it clockwise. Close the lid.\n\n5. Plug in the appliance. A beep will be heard and the display will default to Cycle 1.\n\n6. Press the CYCLE button until your desired cycle is displayed.\n\n7. Press the LOAF SIZE button to move the arrow to 1.5- or 2-lb. loaf size. (Loaf size is not an option in Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.)\n\n8. Press the CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust. (Crust is not adjustable in Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 5.)\n\n9. If desired, set the DELAY TIMER with the + and \u2013 buttons.  \n   **NOTE:** Do not use this feature when using dairy, eggs, etc.\n\n10. Press the START/STOP button to begin the cycle. Breadmaker will beep once and the \u201c- -\u201d in the digital display will begin to flash indicating the timer is counting down. The kneading paddle will begin to mix your ingredients. If Delay Timer was activated, kneading paddle will not mix ingredients until cycle is set to begin.\n\n11. For add-ins (nuts, raisins), the machine will beep at the start of the second kneading. Open the lid and pour in your add-ins. This timing varies by cycle. (Refer to the Timetable for Cycles chart.)\n\n12. Once the cycle is complete, the machine will beep 10 times and shift to the Keep Warm setting for 1 hour.\n\n13. To stop the machine, press the START/STOP button for 2 seconds and the Keep Warm setting will end. Unplug the power cord and then open the lid using oven mitts.\n\n14. Let the bread pan cool down slightly before removing the bread. Using oven mitts, carefully turn the bread pan counterclockwise to unlock and lift up on the handle to remove from the machine.\n\n15. Using oven mitts, turn the bread pan upside down (with the bread pan handle folded down) onto a wire cooling rack or clean cooking surface and gently shake until bread falls out. Use a nonstick spatula to gently loosen the sides of the bread from the bread pan.\n\n16. If kneading paddle remains in the bread, gently pry it out using a spatula or small utensil. When not in use or when operation is complete, unplug the power cord.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate actions to achieve the task. When generating actions, please only generate the ones listed in the available actions. For example, if the listed action has one called \u201cpress_power_button\u201d, you can call it once by returning \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=1)\u201d. You can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return \u201crun_action('press_power_button', execution_times=3)\u201d. If an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d and \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 1)\u201d, try to call it as \u201crun_action('press_power_button', 2)\u201d instead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return \u201cend\u201d (note it should be \"end\", not \"run_action('end')\"). \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call 'end' to end the execution early. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work, then you can call it by returning \"run_action(\"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", execution_times=1, duration=5)\". If the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if press and hold a button leads to a variable value being changed rapidly, please use the regular \"press a button\" action to adjust variables one by one instead, as our simulated appliance does not support such feature. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nIf you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return \"end\" as an action, to save inference cost.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing two variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. variable_response_string (string) \u2013 Contains either:\n    A \"run_action\" function call for the next step.\n    The string \"end\" if no further actions are needed.\n    \nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\".\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\nvariable_response_string = \"run_action('turn_dial_clockwise', execution_times=3)\"\n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button).\nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nKeep variable_response_string directly executable, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
