The control panel display will light up and will sound a long beep. The appliance will automatically be set to the BASIC programme with the crust setting at MEDIUM. The display will show 3:00.\n2. Choose a Programme with the MENU button.\n3. Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed).\n4. Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed).\n5. Press START/STOP button to start the breadmaker.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\n\nDuring the baking process, the main body and the lid will get hot. Be careful not to burn yourself.  \nTo cancel during a process, press and hold the START/STOP button until the breadmaker sounds once.\n- Only as do this in an emergency, as the breadmaker will reset to the beginning of its program. You must then begin again as the ingredients may be ruined and need replacing.\n- Only press this button after you have selected the Menu Program, Crust Colour (and Delay Time if required). Otherwise, it will not reset.\n\nWhen the breadmaker is operating, only open the lid at the prescribed places in the baking cycle. Failure to observe this will affect the quality of the bread, especially its ability to rise properly.\n\n**Setting the Delay Timer**\n\nThe time delay function allows you to delay the start time of baking by up to 12 hours, depending on the length of the baking cycle.\n\nFor example: It is 8:00p.m. and you want to have fresh bread (using the Basic setting) at 7:00a.m.\n\nThe the difference between now (8:00p.m.) and 7:00a.m. is 11 hours. Connect the breadmaker to the mains socket. The preset cycle of 3:00 hours will be displayed.\n\n| Steps                                                                 | Display / Button          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Set the display time to 11:00 (The time difference between now and   | Up arrow, down arrow      |\n| when you want the bread).                                            | 1 11:00                   |\n| Press to add time in 10 minutes steps.                               | TIME +                    |\n| Press to deduct time in 10 minutes steps.                            | TIME -                    |\n| Press the START/STOP button to start time delayed baking.            | START/STOP                |\n\nIf you keep the TIME+ or TIME- buttons pressed, they will cycle to a maximum of 13:00 hours and reset to the preset programme time (in this case 3:00 hours).\n\nThe timer display shows the total time left (in hours and minutes) until the bread is finished (including the delay added and the programme time). It does not display the 1 hour KEEP WARM time after the programme is finished.\n\nRemember to press the START/STOP button to commence the timer countdown - otherwise nothing will happen. If you set the timer incorrectly after the START/STOP button has been pressed, you are able to switch off and reset the delay period again only if mixing has not started.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
