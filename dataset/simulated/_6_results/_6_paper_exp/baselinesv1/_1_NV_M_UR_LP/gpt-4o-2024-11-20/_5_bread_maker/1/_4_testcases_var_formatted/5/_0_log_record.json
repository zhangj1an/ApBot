The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. \n\nYou can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: \n\npress_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.\n\nIn particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. \n\nCurrently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: \n\nGet a gluten-free loaf with a medium crust ready for lunch tomorrow, loaf size is 2.0lb, set the delay timer to 4 hours, and start the bread maker.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**Rosewill\u00ae 2-POUND BREAD MAKER RHBM-15001 USER MANUAL**\n\n**HOW TO MAKE BREAD**\n\n1. Place the pan in position and turn it clockwise until it clicks into correct position. Insert the kneading blade onto the drive shaft. It is recommended to fill holes with heat-resistant margarine prior to installing the kneaders; this prevents the dough from sticking below the kneaders and the kneaders can be more easily removed from bread.\n\n2. Place ingredients into the bread pan. Please follow the order as outlined in the recipe. Usually the water or liquid substance should be added first, then sugar, salt and flour; always add yeast or baking powder as the final ingredient.\n   Note: For the maximum quantities of the flour and yeast which may be used, refer to the recipe.\n\n3. Use your finger to make a small indentation on one side of the flour. Add yeast to indentation. Make sure yeast does not come into contact with the liquid ingredients or salt.\n\n4. Close the lid gently and plug the power cord into a wall outlet.\n\n5. Press the Menu button until your desired program is selected.\n\n6. Press the COLOR button to select the desired crust color.\n\n7. Press the LOAF button to select the desired size \u2013 1.5LB or 2.0LB.\n\n8. Set the delay time by pressing the + or \u2013 buttons. This step may be skipped if you want the bread maker to start working immediately.\n\n9. Press the START/STOP button to start working, the working light will illuminate.\n\n10. For the Basic, French, Whole Wheat, Quick, Sweet, Rapid Bake, Cake and Sandwich programs, 10 beep sounds will be heard during operation. This is to prompt you to add ingredients. It is possible that steam will escape through the vent slits in the lid during baking. This is normal.\n\n11. Once the process has been completed, 10 beep sounds will be heard, and the working light will extinguish. Press START/STOP button for approx. 2 seconds to stop the process and remove bread. Open the lid and while using oven mitts, firmly grasp the bread pan handle. Turn the pan counter-clockwise and gently pull the pan straight up and out of the machine.\n\n12. Use non-stick spatula to gently loosen the sides of the bread from the pan. \nCaution: The Bread pan and bread may be very hot! Always handle with care and use oven mitts.\n\n13. Turn bread pan upside down onto a clean cooking surface and gently shake until bread falls out onto rack.\n\n14. Remove the bread carefully from the pan and cool for about 20 minutes before slicing.\n\n15. If you are out of the room or have not pressed START/STOP button at the end of operation, the bread will be kept warm automatically for 1 hour. If you would like to take the bread out, switch the program off with the START/STOP button.\n\n16. When not in use, unplug the power cord.\nNote: Before slicing the loaf, use the hook to remove the kneading blade hidden on the bottom of loaf. The loaf will be hot \u2013 never use bare hands to remove the kneading blade.\n\n**DELAY FUNCTION**  \nUse this button to delay the start time for your desired program.  \nBegin by determining the when a freshly baked loaf of bread is desired, then press the \u201c+\u201d and \u201c\u2013\u201d buttons to set the required time in 10-minute increments. Please note: Total time should include the delay time and the baking time of the selected program. In other words, at the completion of the total delay time, hot bread will be ready. Maximum delay time is 13 hours.\n\n**Example:** At 8:30 p.m, if you would like your bread to be ready in the next morning at 7 a.m., i.e. in 10 hours and 30 minutes, select your menu, color, and loaf size, then press the \u201c+\u201d or \u201c\u2013\u201d to add the time until \u201c10:30\u201d appears on the LCD screen. Then press the STOP/START button to activate this program. The dot will flash and the display will count down, showing the remaining time. You will get fresh bread at 7 o\u2019clock in the morning. If you don\u2019t want to take out the bread immediately, the keep warm time of 1 hour will begin automatically.\n\n**Note:** 1. This button is not applicable for the Rapid Bake, Jam or Bake programs.  \n2. For time-delayed baking, do not use any easily perishable ingredients such as eggs, fresh milk, fruits, vegetables, etc.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
