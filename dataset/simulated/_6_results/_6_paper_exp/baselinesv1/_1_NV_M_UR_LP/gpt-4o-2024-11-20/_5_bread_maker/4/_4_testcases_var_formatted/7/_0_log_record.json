                    "context_prompt": "Here we attach two images of the appliance. The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. \n\nYou can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: \n\npress_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.\n\nIn particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. \n\nCurrently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: \n\nActivate the Bread Maker and prepare basic bread with a rapid crust and 680g. Use the basic menu and set a 3-hour delay. Use gluten-free setting. Please ensure the appliance starts.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\nThe relevant extracted text from the user manual to help operate the bread maker for the specified goal is:\n\n---\n\n**BREAD MAKING**\n\n1. Follow steps 1 to 7 on page 9 to set up the bread maker.\n2. Press the MENU button until the preferred auto menu number is shown on the display screen.\n3. To change the crust colour, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through Light, Medium, Dark (and Rapid) on the display screen.\n4. To change the loaf size, press the LOAF SIZE button repeatedly to cycle through 450g, 680g or 900g on the display screen.\n5. Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program.\n\n**RAPID**\n\nThe RAPID bread selection makes a loaf of bread in less time and is available on BASIC, WHOLE WHEAT, FRENCH and SWEET bread menus.\n\nSelecting Rapid will bake a bread loaf to a medium crust colour and reduce the finishing time by about an hour. To select, press the CRUST COLOUR button repeatedly to cycle through until RAPID is displayed. (See BREAD, DOUGH & JAM SETTINGS table on page 8 for setting details).\n\n**NOTE**\n\nFor best results, increase the yeast content in your bread recipe by \u00bc teaspoon when using the Rapid setting.\n\n**TIME DELAY**\n\n1. If desired, press the TIMER button to change the start time on the bread maker.\n2. The time displayed represents the finishing time. For example, if you adjust the Basic Bread default time 3:25 to 5:00, the bread will be finished at the end of 5 hours. The time can be delayed by up to 15 hours.\n3. Press up arrow to increase the time in 10 minute increments or press down arrow to decrease the time in 10 minute increments.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nThe Crust Colour, Loaf Size and Timer can only be adjusted on AUTO MENU selections 1-4. Selection 8 allows for the timer to be adjusted only. All other auto menu selections operate as per their default setting. See AUTO MENU Default Table on page 9.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nIf the Timer is activated, the kneading blade will not mix the ingredients until the cycle is set to begin. For example, for Basic Bread the default time to complete the program is 3:25. If the delayed time is changed to 5:00, the cycle will not start for 1 hour 35 minutes after pressing START.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nPress START/CANCEL to start a selected MENU program.\n\n**WARNING**\n\nDo not touch the moving parts in the bread maker while the machine is working.\n\n4. Once the baking cycle is complete, the bread maker will beep 10 times and switch to the Keep Warm setting for 1 hour. Press START/CANCEL for 1 second to cancel the Keep Warm function.\n5. After 1 hour on the Keep Warm setting, the bread maker will beep once.\n6. Let the bread pan cool down slightly before removing. Use oven mitts to lift the handle, and twist carefully to remove the bread pan from the bread maker.\n7. To remove the bread loaf, turn the bread pan upside down and lightly shake until the loaf falls onto a wire cooling rack or clean surface.\n8. Allow bread to cool for at least 10 minutes.\n9. Remove the kneading blade from the base of the bread by using the kneading blade hook supplied. Hook the kneading blade hook into the groove in the centre of the kneading blade, and carefully pull out.\n\n---\n\n**GLUTEN FREE**\n\n1. Press the GLUTEN FREE button on the control panel. GLUTEN FREE will display on the screen.\n2. Press the START/CANCEL button to commence.\n\n**NOTE**\n\nGluten Free can also be selected by pressing MENU until GLUTEN FREE setting 10 is displayed on the screen.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
