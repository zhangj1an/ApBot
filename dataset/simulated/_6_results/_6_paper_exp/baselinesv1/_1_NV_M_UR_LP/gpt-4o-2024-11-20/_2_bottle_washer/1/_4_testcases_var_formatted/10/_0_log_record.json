                    "context_prompt": "Here we attach two images of the appliance. The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. \n\nYou can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: \n\npress_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.\n\nIn particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. \n\nCurrently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: \n\nActivate the appliance and opt for a 60-minute automatic sterilize and dry run, considering cold weather conditions.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\nSet-up and Use\n\nBefore placing items in the appliance for sterilization it is important that\n\nAll bottles, pump parts and accessories must be EMPTY, CLEAN & FULLY RINSED BEFORE USE in this sterilizer dryer\n\n1. Place the appliance on a flat surface where it is out of reach of children and it will not be knocked or moved during operation.\n2. Remove the lid, baskets and accessory rack from the sterilizer base.\n3. Pour water on the base/heater surface to MAX line (165ml/5.5oz).  \n   Never fill past MAX line. We recommend using distilled water to avoid mineral scale build-up on the heating plate. However, you can use bottled water or tap water but you may need to descale more frequently.\n4. Place the lower basket on the base.\n5. Place clean bottles with their opening facing downward on the bottle posts.\n6. Place the accessory tray in the lower basket (tray not for use with tall bottles).\n7. Place bottle accessories on the accessory rack (nipples, collars, caps, etc).\n8. Place the upper basket on top of the lower basket, ensuring that it fits securely without any gaps.\n9. Place breast pump parts or more accessories in the upper basket.\n10. Press the On/Off (power symbol) button once and the function icons will light up.  \n    Choose your desired function following the instructions below.  \n    If there is no selection of function after pressing on/off button, the appliance will automatically switch off.\n\nAutomatic Sterilize/Dry Function:\n1. Choose the drying time (after steam sterilization): Press the Sterilize/Dry (steam and dry symbol) button 1 time for 30 minute dry time, 2 times for 45 minute dry time, 3 times for 60 minute dry time. The sterilize/dry cycle will start 3 seconds after the last button press.\n2. When the sterilization cycle starts, the timer will count up second-by-second for the duration of the sterilization cycle.\n3. When the sterilization cycle is complete, the appliance will beep, pause for 3 seconds and begin the drying cycle for the amount of time selected in step 1. The timer on the timer will count down second-by-second until it reaches 00:00.\n4. When the drying cycle is completed, the appliance will beep 5 times and switch off automatically.\n\nSterilize only function:\n1. Press the Sterilize (steam symbol) button one time, the timer will display \u201c00:00\u201d and the steam icon. The sterilization cycle will start 3 seconds after pressing the sterilize button and the timer will count up second-by-second for the duration of the sterilization cycle.\n2. When the sterilization cycle is complete, the appliance will beep 5 times and switch off automatically.\n\nDryer only function:\n1. Press the Dry (dry symbol) button 1 time for 30 minute dry time, 2 times for 45 minute dry time, 3 times for 60 minute dry time. The drying cycle will start 3 seconds after the last button is pressed and the timer on the timer will count down second-by-second until it reaches 00:00.\n2. When the drying cycle is completed, the appliance will beep 5 times and switch off automatically.\n\nCaution: If it is necessary to remove water from the base, always POUR AWAY FROM FAN OPENING.  \nNote water pour direction icon on base, and pour in direction of arrow.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
