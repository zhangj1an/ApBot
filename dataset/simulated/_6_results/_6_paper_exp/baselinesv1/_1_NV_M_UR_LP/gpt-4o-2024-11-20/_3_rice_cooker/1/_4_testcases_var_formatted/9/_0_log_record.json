                    "context_prompt": "Here we attach two images of the appliance. The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. \n\nYou can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: \n\npress_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.\n\nIn particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. \n\nCurrently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: \n\nSet to cook bean for 1 hour and 10 minutes, then start.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**Bean, Soup**\n\n| Cooking function | Estimated cooking time | Time regulation       | Preset time |\n|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| Bean             | 90 minutes             | 40 minutes-2 hours    | 1-24 hours  |\n\n1. Put beans and water into the inner pot.  \n2. Follow steps 4 to 5 in \u201cCooking rice\u201d.\n\n**Note**\n\n- Do not exceed the maximum water level indicated in the inner pot, as this may cause the Rice cooker to overflow.\n\n3. Select the Bean or Soup function by pressing the Menu button (fig. 10).  \n4. Press the Start button to start cooking (fig. 8).  \n5. When the cooking is finished, you will hear 4 beeps and the selected cooking function light will be off. The Rice cooker will be in keep warm mode automatically.  \n   \u21aa The keep-warm indicator lights up.\n\n---\n\n**Adjusting the cooking time**\n\nYou can set the cooking time for some menus. Refer to the cooking time table in each chapter for the detailed regulating range.\n\n1. Choose the function you need.\n2. To set a different cooking time, press the Cooking time button (fig. 16), and the default cooking time starts flashing on the display.\n3. Press the Hr. button to set the hour unit (fig. 17).\n4. After the hour unit is set, wait for a few seconds before the hour unit is confirmed, and the minute unit starts flashing on the display.\n5. Press the Min. button to set the minute unit (fig. 17).\n6. Press the start button to confirm the cooking time and start the cooking process.\n\n**Note**\n\n- You can adjust the cooking time only in the Porridge(Porridge) and Reheat(Reheat) function.\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
