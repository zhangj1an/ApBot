                    "context_prompt": "Here we attach two images of the appliance. The first image is the original photo, the second image has some indexed bounding boxes that circles out the control panel elements of the appliances, such as buttons and dials. \n\nYou can interact with these buttons and dials using the 4 following action types: \n\npress_button, press_and_hold_button, turn_dial_clockwise, turn_dial_anti_clockwise.\n\nIn particular, you can press and hold two buttons simulatenously. The other actions can only be executed on one button or dial. \n\nCurrently, we want you to achieve the following user command regarding the appliance: \n\nTurn on the washing machine. Set the machine to Fuzzy, delay start by 5 hours with a 40 L water level, 15-minute wash time, and rinse type of 'Water-Injection Rinse 1 time', then start the machine running.\n\nThe relevant part of the appliance user manual that helps command execution is:\n\n---\n\n**How to Use the Washing Machine**\n\n**How to use the Delay Timer**\n\n1. Press the Power button to turn on the power.  \n2. Select a program.  \n3. Press the Delay Timer button and select the time to finish washing. Each press of the button adds an hour starting from 3 hours to 12 hours later.  \n4. Press the Start/Pause button.  \n5. Add detergent and close the lid. The power turns off after a short time.  \n6. Operations finish at the set time.  \n   - The Delay Timer is unavailable for the Tub Clean programs.  \n   - To change the setting, press the Power button and do the settings again.  \n   - If there is a power outage while the timer is set, the timer setting is cancelled. If this happens, press the Power button again and reset the timer.  \n   - To prevent your laundry from wrinkling, remove it as soon as possible after washing is done.  \n\n---\n\n**Partial Operations Using the Fuzzy Program**\n\n- Repeatedly press the Water Level, Wash, Rinse, Spin buttons until the water level, wash, rinse, and spin settings you want are set. If the indicator is not lit, that operation is not performed.  \n\n- You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L.  \n\n  | Water Level |\n  |-------------|\n  | 59 L        |\n  | 50 L        |\n  | 40 L        |\n  | 35 L        |\n  | 30 L        |\n  | 25 L (Auto) |\n\n- You can set the wash time each time you press the Wash button in a range from 3 to 18 minutes and no washing.  \n\n  | Wash Time  |\n  |------------|\n  | 18 Min     |\n  | 15 Min     |\n  | 12 Min     |\n  | 9 Min      |\n  | 6 Min      |\n  | 3 Min      |\n  | No washing |\n\n- You can set the number and type of rinses by pressing the Rinse button. Each time you press the Rinse button the setting changes in sequence, from Normal Rinse 2 times, Water-Injection Rinse 2 times, no rinsing, Normal Rinse 1 time, Water-Injection Rinse 1 time.  \n\n  | Rinse Type         |\n  |--------------------|\n  | EX 2               |\n  | 2                  |\n  | EX 1               |\n  | 1                  |\n  | No rinsing         |\n\n- You can set the spin time each time you press the Spin button in a range of 1 to 9 minutes and no spinning.  \n\n  | Spin Time  |\n  |------------|\n  | 9 Min      |\n  | 6 Min      |\n  | 3 Min      |\n  | 1 Min      |\n  | No setup   |\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the state of the appliance is still unknown. We will start to receive feedbacks from the display panel once actions are executed. \n\nPlease generate the next action you need to take to achieve the task. Please only use the given action types to act on the existing bounding box indexes. For example, suppose you want to press the power button. From the image, the corresponding index is 5. Then you can call this action by returning:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1 \n\nYou can also call it multiple times. For example, if you want to call \u201cpress_power_button\u201d by 3 times, you can return:\n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 3 \n\nIf an action needs to be called multiple times when adjusting a variable, try to call it in one go as much as possible to reduce inference cost. For example, if you can call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\nand then call \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 1\n\ntry to call it as \n\naction_type = \"press_button\"\nbbox_index = 5 \nexecution_times = 2 \n\ninstead. If you decide that the task has been achieved, return\n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nIf the returned digital display looks too wrong, it means the action cannot be executed to the right place, the task is infeasible. Therefore, you can call \n\naction_type = \"end\"\nbbox_index = None \nexecution_times = None \n\nto end the execution early. If you have tried multiple times and realise the target variable values cannot be achieved exactly, you can just let go and return this \"end\" action to save inference cost. \n\nIn particular, a press_and_hold action must be called with a duration of specific seconds. For example, if an action is called \"press_and_hold_program_button_and_water_level_button\", and it must be pressed for at least 5 seconds to work. By referencing the image, the corresponding index for the two buttons are 2 and 3. then you can call it by returning \n\naction_type = \"press_and_hold_button\"\nbbox_index = [2, 3] \nexecution_times = 1\nduration = 5\n\nIf the user manual did not specify how long it needs to be pressed, you can just set the duration to be 10 to be safe. \n\nNote that if the appliance's power can be turned on or off, or can be set to start running or pause, remember to set these parameters.\n\nYou need to generate a Python response containing the following 5 variables:\n\n1. variable_reason (string) \u2013 Explains your reasoning, including:\n    What has been completed.\n    What still needs to be done.\n    Why you are choosing a specific action.\n2. action_type (string) - the answer can only be one of the following: \"press_button\", \"press_and_hold_button\", \"turn_dial_clockwise\", \"turn_dial_anti_clockwise\", or \"end\". If action_type = \"end\", the value of bbox_index, execution_times and duration will all be None.\n3. bbox_index (int or list of integer) - if the action is regarding one button, return one integer. if the action is press and hold two buttons, return a list containing these two integers. \n4. execution_times (int) - the number of times to repeat this action. \n5. duration (index) - if the action type is press_and hold_button, you need to indicate the number of seconds to hold it. Otherwise duration = None. \n\nExample Scenario:\nSuppose you need to set the juicer's power level to \"3\" by turning the power dial clockwise from \"OFF\" \u2192 \"1\" \u2192 \"2\" \u2192 \"3\". From the image, the dial bbox index is 8.\n\nYour first response should be:\n\nvariable_reason = \"Current power value is OFF. I will turn the dial clockwise 3 times to set the value to 3. Then all parameters are set.\"\naction_type = \"turn_dial_clockwise\"\nbbox_index = 8\nexecution_times = 3\nduration = None \n\nGuidelines:\n\nChoose only one action per response (e.g., turn a dial, press a button). \nEnsure clarity in variable_reason so the reasoning is easy to understand.\nOnly return the 5 variables as Python code and nothing else, as it will be evaluated using eval().\nYour response should always be in Python without any additional text outside the code block.\n\n"
