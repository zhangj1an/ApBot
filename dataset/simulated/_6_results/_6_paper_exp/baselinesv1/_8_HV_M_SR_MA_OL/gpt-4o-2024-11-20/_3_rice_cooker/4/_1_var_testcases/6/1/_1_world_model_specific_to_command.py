# Python comments to confirm the accuracy of the provided code:

# Relevant steps needed to achieve the user command:
# To schedule the 'STEAM' function to finish in 5 hours and then start the machine:
# 1. Navigate to the STEAM function by setting the `variable_menu_index` to "steam".
#    This step is effectively modeled in the "set_menu" feature.
# 2. Set the delay time to 5 hours using the `variable_delay_time`.
#    This step is effectively modeled in the "set_delay_time" feature.
# 3. Start the machine using the `variable_start_running`, setting it to "on".
#    This step is effectively modeled in the "start_cooking" feature.

# Relevant portions from the user manual:
# From the manual under "Reservation":
# - "Press the 'DELAY' button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button 'DELAY' again to adjust 
#   the displayed reservation time."
# - "Press the 'START' button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# Relevant feature list names in the given code:
# - "set_menu" to set the menu to "steam".
# - "set_delay_time" to configure the delay time.
# - "start_cooking" to start the machine and conclude the scheduling.

# Goal variable values required to achieve the command:
# - `variable_menu_index`: "steam"
# - `variable_delay_time`: 5 (hours)
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
