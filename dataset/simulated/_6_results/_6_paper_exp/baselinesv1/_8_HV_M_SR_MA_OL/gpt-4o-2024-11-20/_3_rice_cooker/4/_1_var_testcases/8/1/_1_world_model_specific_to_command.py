# The given user command is to cook 'STEW' with a reservation timer set for 4 hours, then start the machine.

# Checking if the given code correctly models the relevant features:
# From the user manual:
# 1. To set a reservation timer (DELAY):
# - Press the DELAY button, and then adjust the timer (user manual explicitly mentions timer value can be adjusted).
# 2. To select the 'STEW' function:
# - Menu selection allows changing between "stew", "soup", "steam", etc.
# 3. Start the machine:
# - Press the start button.

# The provided code models these features with:
# - variable_delay_time for setting the reservation timer, and
#   feature_list["set_delay_time"] to handle its adjustment.
# - variable_menu_index for selecting the menu (like 'stew'), with a mapping to specific variables in menu_setting_dict.
# - feature_list["start_cooking"] for starting the machine.
# Therefore, the provided code is correctly implemented to handle the requested command.

# Steps to achieve the user command:
# 1. Adjust the menu to "stew" using the "set_menu" feature:
#   - Relevant part of the user manual: "Close the lid, press the MENU button, and select STEW."
#   - Corresponding feature: feature_list["set_menu"].
# 2. Set a reservation timer for 4 hours using the "set_delay_time" feature:
#   - Relevant part of the user manual: "Press the DELAY button, the Time Display flashes, and adjust the displayed reservation time."
#   - Corresponding feature: feature_list["set_delay_time"].
# 3. Start the machine using the "start_cooking" feature:
#   - Relevant part of the user manual: "Press the START button; the cooking will start."
#   - Corresponding feature: feature_list["start_cooking"].

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_menu_index to "stew" (menu selection).
# - Set variable_delay_time to 4 (hours) (reservation timer).
# - Set variable_start_running to "on" (start the machine).
