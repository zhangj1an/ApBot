# The provided code appears to effectively model the relevant features and variables needed to execute the described task. 
# Based on the user manual and the requested command, here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "set_menu" feature to select "Quinoa" as the cooking mode.
# 2. Adjust the cooking time to 35 minutes using the same "set_menu" feature (step 2 specifically).
# 3. Use "start_cooking" feature to initiate the cooking process.

# Supporting raw user manual text:
# - "Press menu button to scroll through preset functions, White Rice, Brown Rice, Quinoa, Steel Cut Oats. Indicator light shows which function is selected. Press start if cooking time is okay. Use + and - if you want to adjust time."
# - "Press to start cooking."

# Feature list from the code:
# - feature_list["set_menu"]: Allows setting the menu and adjusting the time for the selected menu.
# - feature_list["start_cooking"]: Starts the cooking process.

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# 1. Set `variable_menu_index` to "Quinoa".
# 2. Set `variable_menu_setting` to "35".
# 3. Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
