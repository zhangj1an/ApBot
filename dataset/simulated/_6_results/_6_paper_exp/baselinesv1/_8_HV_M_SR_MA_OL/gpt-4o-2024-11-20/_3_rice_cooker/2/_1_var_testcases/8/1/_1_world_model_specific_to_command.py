# Analyzing the user command against the given code and user manual:
# The current code appears to correctly model the relevant appliance features required to achieve the user command.
# Let's verify the relevant steps in the user manual against the implemented features:

# 1. "Set the mode to soup":
# User manual: "Press Menu/Cancel to choose Fast cook, White rice, Congee, Soup, Cake, Keep warm."
# This corresponds to `feature_list["select_cooking_mode"]` in the given code.
# Variable: `variable_cooking_mode`.

# 2. "Set timer to 6 hours":
# User manual: "Press Preset/Timer to adjust the preset timer in 15-minute increments up to 24 hours."
# This corresponds to `feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"]` in the given code.
# Variable: `variable_preset_timer`.

# 3. "Start the machine":
# User manual: "Press Start to start the cooking process."
# This corresponds to `feature_list["start_cooking"]` in the given code.
# Variable: `variable_start_running`.

# Sequence of features required:
# 1. "select_cooking_mode" to set mode to "soup".
# 2. "adjust_preset_timer" to set the timer to 6 hours.
# 3. "start_cooking" to set `variable_start_running` to "on".

# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_cooking_mode`: "soup".
# - `variable_preset_timer`: 360 (6 hours in minutes).
# - `variable_start_running`: "on".
