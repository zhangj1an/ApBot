# Review:

# The given code correctly models the steps and actions needed for setting a menu, enabling delay start, and starting the machine. 
# The user manual process for achieving the user command "Set 'WHITE RICE' with a delayed start time of 6 hours, then start the machine" is well-implemented in combination of the features:
# 1. "set_menu" - allows selecting the menu to 'WHITE RICE'.
# 2. "set_delay_time" - correctly allows setting delay time to 6 hours.
# 3. "start_cooking" - starts the appliance.

# Relevant user manual sections:
# From the user manual:
# "After closing the lid, select Quick Rice or other functions by using the Quick Rice or MENU button."
# "Set the timer for cooking completion: Press the “DELAY” button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
# "Start cooking: Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."

# Features in the provided code:
# 1. feature_list["set_menu"] - to select 'WHITE RICE'.
# 2. feature_list["set_delay_time"] - to set a 6-hour delay time.
# 3. feature_list["start_cooking"] - to start cooking.

# Command to achieve the user action:
# - Use the "set_menu" feature to set `variable_menu_index` to "white_rice".
# - Use the "set_delay_time" feature to set `variable_delay_time` to 6.
# - Use the "start_cooking" feature to set `variable_start_running` to "on".
# The code already models this precisely.

# Goal Variable Values for the Command:
# - variable_menu_index = "white_rice"
# - variable_delay_time = 6
# - variable_start_running = "on"
