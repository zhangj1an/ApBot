# User command requires adjustment of cooking mode, preset timer, and starting the machine.
# Let's verify against the user manual and code, for accuracy of modelling features.

# **Findings:** 
# The code correctly models the cooking mode setting using `feature_list["select_cooking_mode"]`.
# The preset timer is accurately modeled using `feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"]`.
# The start process is properly designed within `feature_list["start_cooking"]`.
# No missing features or variables were identified in the code.

# **Steps and Raw Manual Descriptions:**
# 1. Set the mode to white rice:
#    - User manual: “Press Menu/Cancel to choose Fast cook, White rice, etc."
#    - Feature: `feature_list["select_cooking_mode"]`
# 2. Set the preset timer for 2 hours:
#    - User manual: “Choose a function, press Preset/Timer to set the preset timer. The preset time is up to 24 hours.”
#    - Feature: `feature_list["adjust_preset_timer"]`
# 3. Start the machine:
#    - User manual: “Press Start to start the cooking process.”
#    - Feature: `feature_list["start_cooking"]`

# **Goal Variable Values:**
# - `variable_cooking_mode`: "white rice"
# - `variable_preset_timer`: 120 (2 hours = 120 minutes, in preset timer represented as minutes)
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
