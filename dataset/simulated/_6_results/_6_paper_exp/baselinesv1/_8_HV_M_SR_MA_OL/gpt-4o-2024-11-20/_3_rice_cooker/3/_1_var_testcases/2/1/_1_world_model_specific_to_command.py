# Python comments checking if the current code accurately models the requested user command:
# The current code accurately models the appliance features required for the command. We confirm this by verifying:
# 
# 1. Adjust the delay time to 2 hours:
# - User manual: "1. **Delay Timer**: Press Delay Timer to delay the start of your cooker cycle. 
#   The unit will only start to cook after the countdown is complete. Use + and - to increase or decrease the desired start time, in increments of 30 minutes. Delay can be from 1 - 24 hours."
# - Feature list: "adjust_delay_timer": Adjusts variable_delay_timer using press_delay_timer_button and press_plus_button/press_minus_button.
# 
# 2. Set the rice cooker to Brown Rice:
# - User manual: "**Menu**: Press menu button to scroll through preset functions, White Rice, Brown Rice, Quinoa, Steel Cut Oats. 
#   Indicator light shows which function is selected."
# - Feature list: "set_menu": Sets variable_menu_index with press_menu_button and adjusts the menu setting.
# 
# 3. Start running:
# - User manual: "Press to start cooking."
# - Feature list: "start_cooking": Sets variable_start_running to "on" using press_start_button.

# Sequence of features needed for this command:
# 1. "adjust_delay_timer" to set the delay time to 2 hours.
# 2. "set_menu" to select the Brown Rice menu.
# 3. "start_cooking" to begin cooking.

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - variable_delay_timer -> 2 (hours).
# - variable_menu_index -> "Brown Rice".
# - variable_start_running -> "on".
