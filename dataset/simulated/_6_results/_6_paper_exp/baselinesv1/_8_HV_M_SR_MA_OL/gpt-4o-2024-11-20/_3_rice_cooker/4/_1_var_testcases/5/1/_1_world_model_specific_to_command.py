# The required user command is: Set it to cook 'MIXED' rice with a reservation timer set for 6 hours, then start the machine.
# Upon reviewing the relevant appliance features:
# 1. The feature `set_menu` describes setting the menu to 'MIXED' using `press_menu_button`. 
#    This feature is accurately represented in the provided feature_list.
# 2. The feature `set_delay_time` handles setting the delay timer, which is explained in the user manual's reservation instructions.
#    This feature is well-represented in the current code.
# 3. The feature `start_cooking` ensures starting the cooking process. This is correctly implemented in the feature_list.
# 
# Therefore, the required user command can be achieved using the code. The sequence of features and their relevant manual text and feature_list names are as follows:
# 
# **Manual Text Extract on Reservation:**
# 
# 1. "After closing the lid, select Quick Rice or other functions by using the Quick Rice or MENU button."
#    - Feature: `set_menu` (Assign menu to 'MIXED' rice)
# 
# 2. "Press the “DELAY” button, the Time Display flashes, and then press the button “DELAY” again to adjust the displayed reservation time."
#    - Feature: `set_delay_time` (Set reservation time to 6 hours)
# 
# 3. "Press the “START” button, the cooking will be finished at the appointed time."
#    - Feature: `start_cooking` (Start the cooking process)
# 
# Using the descriptions above, the currently provided feature_list can achieve the user command.
# Goal variable values to achieve this task:
# - Set `variable_menu_index` to "mixed".
# - Set `variable_delay_time` to 6 hours.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to "on".
