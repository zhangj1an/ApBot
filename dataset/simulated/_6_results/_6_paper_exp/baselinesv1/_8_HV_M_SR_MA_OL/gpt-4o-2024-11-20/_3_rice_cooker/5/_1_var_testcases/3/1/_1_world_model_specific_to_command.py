# Python comment: Let's verify the given code to evaluate if it adequately models the required appliance feature, as described in the user command:
# "Turn on the cooker and set it to brown rice mode for a preset time of 5 hours. Then start the machine."

# After examining the user manual's instructions and the provided implementation, it appears that the code accurately models all relevant features described in the manual. 
# Here is the sequence of steps to execute the given user command, using the implemented feature_list:

# Sequence of Features Needed to Achieve the User Command:
# 1. Start the appliance using the "start_appliance" feature.
# 2. Select the "brown rice" cooking program using the "select_cooking_program" feature.
# 3. Adjust the preset time to 5 hours (300 minutes) using the "adjust_preset_time" feature.
# 4. Start cooking the machine using the "start_appliance" feature (press start button).

# Relevant User Manual Text Corresponding to Features:
# - "Press START to turn on the appliance and start the cooking program." (start_appliance feature)
# - "To select a cooking program, press the corresponding program button (e.g., White Rice, Brown Rice, Glutinous Rice, etc.)." (select_cooking_program feature)
# - "Press PRESET to set a preset time for cooking (maximum 24 hours)." (adjust_preset_time feature)
# - "When ready, press START to begin the cooking process." (start_appliance feature)

# Features in feature_list:
# - feature_list["start_appliance"]
# - feature_list["select_cooking_program"]
# - feature_list["adjust_preset_time"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set variable_start_running to "on".
# - Set variable_cooking_program to "brown_rice".
# - Set variable_preset_time to 300 (minutes).
# - Ensure variable_start_running is "on" to start the cooking process.
