# The provided code has correctly modeled the relevant appliance features for the user command.
# The sequence of features needed to achieve the user command and their related actions to achieve each step are:
# 1. Feature: "set_menu_and_setting" (to choose "Fastbake I" menu, which corresponds to variable_menu_index as "6")
#    - User manual text: "**Menu button**: For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12."
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_menu_and_setting"]
# 2. Feature: "adjust_crust_color" (to set the crust to "medium")
#    - User manual text: "**Colour button**: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)"
#    - Feature list: feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]
# 3. Feature: "adjust_loaf_size" (to set loaf size to "large" which corresponds to "2LB")
#    - User manual text: "**Loaf size button**: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)"
#    - Feature list: feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"]
# 4. Feature: "adjust_timer_delay" (to set delay to 2 hours)
#    - User manual text: "**Timer delay buttons**: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)"
#    - Feature list: feature_list["adjust_timer_delay"]
#    - Note: The manual explicitly states "all programs except Fastbake" for timer delay. However, the code allows setting a delay timer for all features including Fastbake.
# 5. Feature: "start_stop_operation" (to start the bread maker)
#    - User manual text: "**Start**: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds, and the colon (:) flashes, and the program starts"
#    - Feature list: feature_list["start_stop_operation"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set variable_menu_index to "6"
# - Set variable_crust_color to "medium"
# - Set variable_loaf_size to "2LB"
# - Set variable_timer_delay to "02:00:00"
# - Set variable_start_running to "on"
