# The current code already models the relevant appliance features to achieve the provided user command "Basic Bread with No Delay" correctly. 
# Let's break down the sequence of features needed to achieve this user command, followed by quoting the relevant raw user manual text and coded feature list names:

# 1. Select the Basic program:
# - Relevant raw user manual text:
#   "1) Choose a Programme with the MENU button." 
# - Feature in the code: feature_list["set_menu"]
# - Goal variable value: variable_menu_index = "1" (Basic Program)

# 2. Choose a loaf size of 700g:
# - Relevant raw user manual text:
#   "3) Press LOAF SIZE button to select the Loaf Size (as needed)."
# - Feature in the code: feature_list["set_loaf_size"]
# - Goal variable value: variable_loaf_size = "700g"

# 3. Set the crust color to Light:
# - Relevant raw user manual text:
#   "4) Press COLOR button to select the Crust Colour (as needed)."
# - Feature in the code: feature_list["set_crust_color"]
# - Goal variable value: variable_crust_color = "Light"

# 4. Set the delay timer to 3 hours:
# - Relevant raw user manual text:
#   "Use these buttons when you would like to delay the completion of your bread. To set the Timer, determine when you would like your bread to be ready, then set the Timer."
# - Feature in the code: feature_list["set_delay_timer"]
# - Goal variable value: variable_delay_timer = 180 (3 hours in minutes)

# 5. Power on and start the operation:
# - Relevant raw user manual text:
#   "5) Press START/STOP button to start the breadmaker."
# - Feature in the code: feature_list["start_stop_program"]
# - Goal variable value: variable_start_running = "on"

# Final implementation:
