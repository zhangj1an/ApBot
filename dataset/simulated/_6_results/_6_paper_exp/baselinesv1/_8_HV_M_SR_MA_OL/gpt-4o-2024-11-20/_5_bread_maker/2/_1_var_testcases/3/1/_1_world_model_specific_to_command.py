# Python comment: The current code accurately models the appliance's feature list as per the user manual. No features or variables are missing. Below is the sequence of features required to achieve the given user command.

# Sequence of features to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use the feature "set_menu_and_setting" to select the "sweet" menu.
# 2. Use the feature "adjust_loaf_size" to select the loaf size as "1.5LB" (small).
# 3. Use the feature "adjust_crust_color" to set the crust color to "light".
# 4. Use the feature "adjust_timer_delay" to set the timer delay to 4 hours.
# 5. Use the feature "start_stop_operation" to start the breadmaker.

# Relevant user manual text describing the features and actions:
# - "Menu button: For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12."
# - "Loaf size button: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)."
# - "Colour button: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
# - "Timer delay buttons: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)."
# - "Start: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts."

# Corresponding feature_list names in the given code:
# - "set_menu_and_setting" for selecting a menu (sweet menu = "5").
# - "adjust_loaf_size" for setting the loaf size (small = "1.5LB").
# - "adjust_crust_color" for setting the crust color (light = "light").
# - "adjust_timer_delay" for setting a 4 hours delay.
# - "start_stop_operation" for starting the breadmaker.

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# - variable_menu_index = "5" (Sweet menu).
# - variable_loaf_size = "1.5LB" (Small size).
# - variable_crust_color = "light" (Light crust).
# - variable_timer_delay = "04:00:00" (4 hours delay).
# - variable_start_running = "on" (Start the breadmaker).
