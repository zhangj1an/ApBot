# Given the current Simulator implementation, it is accurate and aligns with the user manual to achieve the user command. 
# Here is the sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Set the menu to French:
# User Manual: "For the baking of light weight bread such as french bread which has a crisper crust and light texture."
# Feature: feature_list["set_menu_and_setting"] and variable_menu_index set to "2".

# 2. Set loaf size to large:
# User Manual: "Press Loaf size button to choose between small or large."
# Feature: feature_list["adjust_loaf_size"] and variable_loaf_size set to "2LB".

# 3. Set crust color to medium:
# User Manual: "For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
# Feature: feature_list["adjust_crust_color"] and variable_crust_color set to "medium".

# 4. Set timer delay to 2 hours:
# User Manual: "Use the timer when you want the bread ready later, or in the morning. A maximum of 13 hours can be set."
# Feature: feature_list["adjust_timer_delay"] and variable_timer_delay set to "02:00:00".

# 5. Start the breadmaker:
# User Manual: "Press Start. Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts."
# Feature: feature_list["start_stop_operation"] and variable_start_running set to "on".

# Generate goal variable values to achieve the command.
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_menu_index": "2",  # French
    "variable_menu_setting": "3:50:00",  # Matches the French menu time
    "variable_loaf_size": "2LB",  # Large
    "variable_crust_color": "medium",  # Medium crust
    "variable_timer_delay": "02:00:00",  # 2-hour delay
    "variable_start_running": "on"  # Start operation
}
