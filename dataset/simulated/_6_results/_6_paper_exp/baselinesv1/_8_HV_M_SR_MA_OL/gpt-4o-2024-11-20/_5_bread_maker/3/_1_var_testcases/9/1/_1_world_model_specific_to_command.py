# The current implementation of code correctly models the requested user command based on the user manual. 
# Here is the sequence of features needed to achieve this:
# 1. Feature: "select_cycle" → Set variable_cycle to "Quick".
#    User Manual: "Press CYCLE button to select your desired cycle. The corresponding cycle number is shown on the display."
# 2. Feature: "adjust_crust_color" → Set variable_crust_color to "Light".
#    User Manual: "Press CRUST button to move the arrow to desired setting: Light, Medium, or Dark crust."

# 4. Feature: "adjust_delay_timer" → Set variable_delay_timer to 120 (representing 2 hours in minutes).
#    User Manual: "Use the Delay Timer feature to start the breadmaker at a later time. Press the + and – buttons to increase the cycle time shown on the display. Add up to 13 hours including the delay time and breadmaking cycle."
# 5. Feature: "start_or_stop_operation" → Set variable_start_running to "on".
#    User Manual: "Press START/STOP. The digital display will show the time remaining in the cycle."

# Goal Variable Values:
# variable_cycle -> "Quick"
# variable_crust_color -> "Light"
# variable_loaf_size -> "1.5lb"
# variable_delay_timer -> 120
# variable_start_running -> "on"
