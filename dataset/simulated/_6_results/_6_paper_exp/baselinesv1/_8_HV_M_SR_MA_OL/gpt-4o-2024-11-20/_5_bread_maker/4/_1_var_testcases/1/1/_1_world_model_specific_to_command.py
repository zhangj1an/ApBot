# Python Comments:

# The given code has accurately modeled all the relevant appliance features as per the user manual that can be used 
# to achieve the described command. All the variables, features, and their interactions via actions have been correctly implemented.
# Below is the sequence of features required to achieve this command, alongside the corresponding feature_list names and relevant user manual references.

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. Set the Auto Menu to "Basic" (feature_list["set_auto_menu"]).
#    - User manual raw text: "In standby mode, pressing the MENU button will cycle through the auto menu items."
# 2. Set the crust color to "Light" (feature_list["adjust_crust_color"]).

# 4. Activate the gluten-free mode (feature_list["activate_gluten_free_mode"]).
#    - User manual raw text: "Press the GLUTEN FREE button on the control panel. GLUTEN FREE will display on the screen."
# 5. Set the timer for a 1-hour delay start (feature_list["adjust_timer"]).
#    - User manual raw text: "If desired, press the TIMER button to change the start time on the bread maker."
# 6. Start the program (feature_list["start_or_cancel_program"]).
#    - User manual raw text: "Press START/CANCEL when selections are complete to begin the program."

# Goal Variable Values:
goal_variable_values = {
    "variable_menu_index": "Basic",
    "variable_crust_color": "Light",
    "variable_loaf_size": "450g",
    "variable_gluten_free_mode": "on",
    "variable_timer": "01:00:00",  # 1-hour delay
    "variable_start_running": "on"
