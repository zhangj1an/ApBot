According to Rule 4, if the goal string only contains strings but feedback contains numbers, then remove numbers from the feedback completely and just compare the strings. After removing numbers, '7 fastbake ii' becomes 'fastbake ii', which does not match the goal value '7'. Additionally, Rule 5 states that if the variable range has an option that matches the goal value better than the feedback value, the goal has not been reached. Here, the feedback value '7 fastbake ii' does not match the goal value '7' directly, and there is no indication that 'fastbake ii' is the best possible match for '7'. Since this is open loop execution, given a wrong model, we will terminate now. "
