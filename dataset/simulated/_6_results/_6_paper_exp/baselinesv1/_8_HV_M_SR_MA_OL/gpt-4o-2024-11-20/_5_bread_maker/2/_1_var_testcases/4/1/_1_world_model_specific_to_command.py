# Python comment: The current code is accurately modeling the appliance's features based on the given user manual. 
# The relevant sequence of features to achieve the requested command consists of:
# 1. "set_menu_and_setting" feature - sets the menu to "Basic White (1)".
# 2. "adjust_loaf_size" feature - sets the loaf size to "2LB".
# 3. "adjust_crust_color" feature - sets the crust color to "medium".
# 4. "adjust_timer_delay" feature - sets the timer delay to "5 hours (05:00:00)".
# 5. "start_stop_operation" feature - starts the bread maker.

# Raw user manual text corresponding to the features:
# - "Menu button: For choosing the bread making program from the list 1 to 12."
# - "Loaf size button: For selecting small (1.5lb) or large (2lb) loaf size (certain programs only)."
# - "Colour button: For selecting crust colour from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
# - "Timer delay buttons: Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)."
# - "Start: Press to start for approx 1 second, a beep sounds and the colon (:) flashes and the program starts."

# Feature list names in the code:
# 1. "set_menu_and_setting"
# 2. "adjust_loaf_size"
# 3. "adjust_crust_color"
# 4. "adjust_timer_delay"
# 5. "start_stop_operation"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - variable_menu_index = "1" (Basic White menu)
# - variable_menu_setting = "3:00:00" (adjusted based on menu index)
# - variable_loaf_size = "2LB"
# - variable_crust_color = "medium"
# - variable_timer_delay = "05:00:00"
# - variable_start_running = "on"
