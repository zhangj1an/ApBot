# Python comment:
# The given code correctly models the features required to achieve the user command to prepare a large, medium-crust bread with the fastbake 2 menu and a 1-hour timer delay, and then start the bread maker. 
# Below are the steps to be followed:
# 
# Sequence of Features Needed:
# 1. "set_menu_and_setting" to select the "fastbake 2" menu (variable_menu_index).
# 2. "adjust_crust_color" to set the crust to "medium" (variable_crust_color).
# 3. "adjust_loaf_size" to set the loaf size to "2LB" (variable_loaf_size).
# 4. "adjust_timer_delay" to set the timer delay to 1 hour (variable_timer_delay).
# 5. "start_stop_operation" to start the bread maker (variable_start_running).
#
# From the raw user manual:
# - Menu selection: "Press the Menu button to choose the bread-making program from the list 1 to 12."
# - Crust color: "For selecting crust color from light, medium or dark (certain programs only)."
# - Loaf size: "Press the Loaf size button to choose between small (1.5lb) or large (2lb)."
# - Timer Delay: "Use to delay the start of bread making (all programs except Fastbake)."
# - Start: "Press Start for approx. 1 second, a beep sounds, and the program starts."
#
# Feature List Names:
# - "set_menu_and_setting"
# - "adjust_crust_color"
# - "adjust_loaf_size"
# - "adjust_timer_delay"
# - "start_stop_operation"
#
# Goal Variable Values:
# - variable_menu_index: "7" (fastbake 2)
# - variable_crust_color: "medium"
# - variable_loaf_size: "2LB"
# - variable_timer_delay: "01:00:00"
# - variable_start_running: "on"
