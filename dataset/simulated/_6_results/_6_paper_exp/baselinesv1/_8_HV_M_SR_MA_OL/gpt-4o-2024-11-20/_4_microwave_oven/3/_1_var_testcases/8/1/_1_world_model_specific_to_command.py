# The simulator code is accurate enough to achieve the requested command as is.
# Following the provided user manual, the sequence of features needed to achieve the command is as follows:
# 1. "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" for setting the upper tube temperature to 230°C
#    Raw user manual text: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
# 2. "adjust_function_selection" for selecting the cooking function as "upper and lower heating tubes"
#    Raw user manual text: "Select cooking function. ☐ The upper and lower heating tubes heat up at the same time, and the food is evenly heated to achieve a perfect roasting effect."
# 3. "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" for setting the lower tube temperature to 110°C
#    Raw user manual text: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
# 4. "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" for setting the time for 40 minutes and starting the appliance
#    Raw user manual text: "Adjust cooking time. If the cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, then turn the time knob back to the desired time position."
#    Also: "When 'Stay On' gear is selected, the electric oven is in a continuous working state and the power indicator light is lit; to end the work, manually turn the time knob back to the 'OFF' gear."

# Relevant feature list names in the existing code:
# - "adjust_upper_tube_temperature"
# - "adjust_function_selection"
# - "adjust_lower_tube_temperature"
# - "adjust_cooking_time_and_start"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# 1. variable_upper_tube_temperature = 230
# 2. variable_function_selection = "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# 3. variable_lower_tube_temperature = 110
# 4. variable_time_adjustment = 40
# 5. variable_start_running = "on"
