# Python comments for the user command "Time defrost for 5 minutes with 30% power, then start the appliance":

# The given code correctly models the relevant appliance features to achieve the command:
# 1. "time_defrost": This feature allows setting the defrost time using number pads (meta_actions_on_number) and selecting power levels via the power button.
#    - User manual reference: "Press 'TIME DEFROST', screen will display 'dEF2'... Press number pads to input defrosting time. The effective time range is 00:01~99:99...
#      Press 'POWER' once, and the screen will display 'PL3', then press the number pad of the power level you wanted. Press 'START/+30SEC.' to start defrosting."
#    - Code feature: feature_list["time_defrost"]
# 2. The correct sequence of operations to achieve the task is:
#    - Step 1: Activate the "time_defrost" feature.
#    - Step 2: Set the defrost time to 5 minutes using number pads (mapped to variable_time_defrost).
#    - Step 3: Adjust the power level to 30% (PL3) using the power button (variable_power).
#    - Step 4: Start the process using the "press_start_plus_30sec_button" action (variable_start_running).

# No additional modifications or new features are required.

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. Set variable_time_defrost to "00:05:00".
# 2. Set variable_power to "PL3".
# 3. Set variable_start_running to "on" (starts the operation).
