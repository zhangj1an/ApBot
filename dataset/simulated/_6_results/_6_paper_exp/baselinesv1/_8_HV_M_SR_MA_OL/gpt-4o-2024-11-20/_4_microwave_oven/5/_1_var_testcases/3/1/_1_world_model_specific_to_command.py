# The given code does not accurately model the user command as described in the user manual. 
# Specifically, the original code lacks modeling for setting the timer to 60 minutes.
# From the user manual:
# The timer dial allows users to "Turn the Timer dial clockwise to the desired cooking duration. Heating will commence immediately."
# However, the variable_timer_dial in the given code does not model a continuous time range that includes 60 minutes but instead limits timer values to discrete steps: ["Off", "10 minutes", "20 minutes", "30 minutes", "40 minutes"].

# The variable_timer_dial needs to be updated for better modeling of the timer functionality.

# Additionally, a variable to control appliance start or stop running, as inferred from the manual stating "Heating begins immediately," could be considered.

# Below is the revised and corrected ExtendedSimulator:

# Updated variable for the timer dial to allow a continuous range, including 60 minutes
variable_timer_dial = ContinuousVariable(
    value_ranges_steps=[(0, 60, 1)],  # From 0 to 60 minutes with a step of 1 minute
    current_value=0  # Start at 0 minutes
)

# Extend the Simulator with the necessary correction for achieving the user command
updated_feature_list = feature_list  # Start with the existing feature list

    def reset(self):
        super().reset()
        self.variable_timer_dial = variable_timer_dial  # Assign the updated timer variable
