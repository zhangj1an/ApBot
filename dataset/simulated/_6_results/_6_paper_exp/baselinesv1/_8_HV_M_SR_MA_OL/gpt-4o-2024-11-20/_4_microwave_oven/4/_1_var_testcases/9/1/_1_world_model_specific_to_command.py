# The relevant sequence of features and actions required to achieve the user command is as follows:

# 1. Set the function knob to "Lower Heater" using the feature "set_function_knob".
# 2. Set the upper heater temperature to 110°C using the feature "adjust_upper_heater_temperature".
# 3. Set the lower heater temperature to 110°C using the feature "adjust_lower_heater_temperature".
# 4. Set the timer to "60 minutes" using the feature "set_timer".

# User manual text relevant to each feature:
# ● Function knob:
#   □ Operates the lower heater
# ● Upper and lower heaters temperature knobs:
#   Temperature range: 70 °C - 230 °C
# ● Timer:
#   The electric oven beeps when the timer reaches "0".

# Feature names in the code:
# - "set_function_knob"
# - "adjust_upper_heater_temperature"
# - "adjust_lower_heater_temperature"
# - "set_timer"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - variable_function_knob = "Lower Heater"
# - variable_upper_heater_temperature = 110
# - variable_lower_heater_temperature = 110
# - variable_timer = "60"
