# The current code accurately models the specified appliance features for the user-provided command.
# Here is the check and rationale:

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" to set the upper tube temperature to 110°C
# 2. Use "adjust_function_selection" to select the cooking function as upper and lower heating tube
# 3. Use "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" to set the lower tube temperature to 150°C
# 4. Use "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" to set the cooking time to 20 minutes and start the appliance

# Relevant raw user manual text that describes the features:
# - Upper tube temperature adjustment knob: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
# - Function selection knob: "Select cooking function."
# - Lower tube temperature adjustment knob: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
# - Time adjustment knob: "Adjust cooking time. If the cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, then turn the time knob back to the desired time position."
# - Stay On: "When 'Stay On' gear is selected, the electric oven is in a continuous working state and the power indicator light is lit; to end the work, manually turn the time knob back to the 'OFF' gear."

# Feature list names in the given code:
# - "adjust_upper_tube_temperature"
# - "adjust_function_selection"
# - "adjust_lower_tube_temperature"
# - "adjust_cooking_time_and_start"

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_upper_tube_temperature` to 110°C
# - Set `variable_function_selection` to "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# - Set `variable_lower_tube_temperature` to 150°C
# - Set `variable_time_adjustment` to 20 minutes (starts the appliance automatically when time is set)
