# Python comment:
# The given code correctly models the features and variables as per the user manual. It accommodates features like "adjust_upper_tube_temperature", "adjust_function_selection", "adjust_lower_tube_temperature", and "adjust_cooking_time_and_start". These features align with the user command, which specifies setting the upper tube temperature, selecting the cooking function, setting the lower tube temperature, and adjusting the cooking time.

# Sequence of features required to achieve the user command:
# 1. "adjust_upper_tube_temperature": Set variable_upper_tube_temperature to 150°C by turning the upper tube temperature adjustment dial.
#    User Manual Text Reference: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    Feature List Name: adjust_upper_tube_temperature
# 
# 2. "adjust_function_selection": Set variable_function_selection to "upper_and_lower_tubes" by turning the function selection dial.
#    User Manual Text Reference: "Select cooking function. Options include (lower heating tube), (upper heating tube), (upper and lower heating tubes), etc."
#    Feature List Name: adjust_function_selection
# 
# 3. "adjust_lower_tube_temperature": Set variable_lower_tube_temperature to 190°C by turning the lower tube temperature adjustment dial.
#    User Manual Text Reference: "Adjust the lower tube temperature. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
#    Feature List Name: adjust_lower_tube_temperature
# 
# 4. "adjust_cooking_time_and_start": Set variable_time_adjustment to 30 minutes and start the microwave.
#    User Manual Text Reference: "Adjust cooking time. If the cooking time is less than 10 minutes, turn the time knob to more than 10 minutes, then turn it back."
#    Feature List Name: adjust_cooking_time_and_start

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# variable_upper_tube_temperature = 150°C
# variable_function_selection = "upper_and_lower_tubes"
# variable_lower_tube_temperature = 190°C
# variable_time_adjustment = 30 minutes
# variable_start_running = "on"
