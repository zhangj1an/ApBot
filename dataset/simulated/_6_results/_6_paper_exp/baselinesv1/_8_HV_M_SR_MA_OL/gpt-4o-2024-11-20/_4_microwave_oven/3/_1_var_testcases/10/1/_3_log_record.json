Additionally, the goal state specifically refers to 'upper_and_lower_tubes', which might be a specific function option. Based on Rule 5, if there is a closer match in the variable range, the goal has not been reached yet. Since the feedback value does not match exactly and could represent a different function, the goal is not reached. Since this is open loop execution, given a wrong model, we will terminate now. "
