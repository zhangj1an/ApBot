While both refer to similar heating mechanisms, the feedback value includes 'with convection', which is additional information not present in the goal state. Additionally, in the variable range, 'upper_and_lower_tubes' matches the goal value better than the feedback value. Therefore, the goal has not been reached yet. Since this is open loop execution, given a wrong model, we will terminate now. "
