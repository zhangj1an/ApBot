# Python comments to verify and evaluate the current implementation based on the user command:
# The required user command is to use time cooking setting to cook at 70% power for 5 minutes and start the appliance.
# To evaluate, check if the current code includes a suitable feature to achieve this command:
# Relevant feature in the feature_list is "microwave_cook".
# The "microwave_cook" feature includes the sequence to set cooking time, adjust power, and start the appliance, as shown below:

# feature_list["microwave_cook"] = [
#    {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_time_cook_button"]},
#    {"step": 2, "actions": meta_actions_on_number, "variable": "variable_time_cook_time", "comment": "requires parsing from variable_input_string"},
#    {"step": 3, "actions": ["press_power_button"]},
#    {"step": 4, "actions": meta_actions_on_number, "variable": "variable_power"},
#    {"step": 5, "actions": ["press_start_plus_30sec_button"]}
# ]

# The above feature steps perfectly match the user command requirements: 
# Step 1: Select time cooking setting (via "press_time_cook_button").
# Step 2: Set cooking time to 5 minutes using meta_actions_on_number (parsed into variable_time_cook_time in process_input_string()).
# Step 3: Activate power adjustment (via "press_power_button").
# Step 4: Set the power to 70% (PL7).
# Step 5: Start cooking by pressing the "press_start_plus_30sec_button".

# The feature_list and associated variables have been accurately modeled and are sufficient for this command.

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. Set variable_time_cook_time to "00:05:00" (5 minutes).
# 2. Set variable_power to "PL7" (70% power level).
# 3. Set variable_start_running to "on" (via "press_start_plus_30sec_button").
