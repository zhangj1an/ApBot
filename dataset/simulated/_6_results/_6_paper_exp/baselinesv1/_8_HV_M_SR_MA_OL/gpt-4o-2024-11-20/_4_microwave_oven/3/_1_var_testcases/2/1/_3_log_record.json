While the two values are similar in meaning, the feedback includes 'with convection', which does not directly match the goal value. Additionally, based on Rule 5, if the variable range includes 'upper_and_lower_tubes' as an option, it matches the goal value better than the feedback value. Therefore, the goal has not been reached yet. Since this is open loop execution, given a wrong model, we will terminate now. "
