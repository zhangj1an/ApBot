# Based on the user command, the given code has correctly modelled all relevant appliance features and variables
# to set the upper tube temperature, cooking function, lower tube temperature, and time. 
# There is nothing missing from the user manual text.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Adjust the upper tube temperature: "adjust_upper_tube_temperature" (variable_upper_tube_temperature)
# 2. Select the cooking function: "adjust_function_selection" (variable_function_selection)
# 3. Adjust the lower tube temperature: "adjust_lower_tube_temperature" (variable_lower_tube_temperature)
# 4. Adjust the cooking time and start: "adjust_cooking_time_and_start" (variable_time_adjustment and variable_start_running)

# Relevant user manual text for these features:
# - Adjust the upper tube temperature: "Adjust the upper tube temperature. Please do not rotate to less than 70°C during cooking. The adjustable temperature range is 70°C - 230°C."
