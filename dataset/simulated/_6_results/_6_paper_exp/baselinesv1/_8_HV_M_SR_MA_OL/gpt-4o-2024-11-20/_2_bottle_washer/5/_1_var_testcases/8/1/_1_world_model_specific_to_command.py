# Checking the requested user command against the existing code:
# The user command is to "Enable the washer for a 50-minute drying and keep sterile items in storage mode."
# After reviewing the user manual and the provided code, it is evident that all necessary variables and features to achieve this command are correctly modeled.

# The relevant features needed to achieve this user command:
# 1. "drying_only_function" (to set the drying duration to 50 minutes).
#    Raw user manual text: "Press this button once for 30 minutes drying, twice for 40 minutes drying and three times for 50 minutes drying."
#    Feature: feature_list["drying_only_function"]
#
# 2. "storage_function" (to enable storing sterile items in storage mode).
#    Raw user manual text: "Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser. The steriliser will run a programme that emits 5 minutes of UV light and 5 minutes of drying every 2 hours, to ensure items inside remain sterile."
#    Feature: feature_list["storage_function"]

# Based on the above, the current code already includes the necessary variables and features:
# - variable_drying_only_duration
# - variable_storage_mode
# Features:
# - feature_list["drying_only_function"]
# - feature_list["storage_function"]

# Goal variable values for this command:
# - Set variable_drying_only_duration to "50 minutes"
# - Set variable_storage_mode to "on"
