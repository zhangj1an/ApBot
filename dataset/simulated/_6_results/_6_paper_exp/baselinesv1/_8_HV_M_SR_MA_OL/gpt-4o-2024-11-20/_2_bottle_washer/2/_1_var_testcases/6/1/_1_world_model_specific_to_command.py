# Python comment: The current code already models all the relevant appliance features accurately as per the user manual. For the user command, we can follow the sequence of steps using the existing features defined in the code. Below is the process to achieve the command.

# Sequence of features needed to achieve the user command:
# 1. Use feature: "power_and_start_warming" to turn the appliance on.
#    - User manual: **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on.
#    - Feature name in code: "power_and_start_warming".
# 2. Use feature: "select_bottle_type" to set the bottle type to "Silicone".
#    - User manual: | Select bottle | Silicone | 
#    - Feature name in code: "select_bottle_type".
# 3. Use feature: "select_initial_temperature" to set the initial temperature to "Refrig (4℃)".
#    - User manual: | Select initial temp | Refrig- 4℃ (39.2°F) | 
#    - Feature name in code: "select_initial_temperature".
# 4. Use feature: "select_volume" to set the volume to "4-6 fl-oz".
#    - User manual: | Select Volume | 4-6 fl-oz | 
#    - Feature name in code: "select_volume".

# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_bottle_type to "Silicone".
# - Set variable_initial_temp to "Refrig".
# - Set variable_volume to "4-6 fl-oz".
