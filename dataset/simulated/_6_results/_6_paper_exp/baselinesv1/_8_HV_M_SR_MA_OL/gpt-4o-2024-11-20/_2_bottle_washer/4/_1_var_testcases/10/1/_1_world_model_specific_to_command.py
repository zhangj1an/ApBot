# Python comments on user command and required features:

# According to the user command, we need to switch the appliance on, select the "Steam" menu, and adjust the steam time to 18 minutes.
# The existing code seems to correctly model the "turn_on_off_appliance" and "set_and_adjust_menu" features, as they provide clear steps for turning the appliance on and selecting/adjusting menu options.
# The feature "set_and_adjust_menu" includes steps to select the "Steam" menu and adjust its time setting using the "+" and "-" buttons.

# Relevant user manual texts:
# - "Tap the power button to turn on the machine."
# - "Tap the menu button until the steam function appears. The default time is 12 minutes. To adjust the time use the +/- to add or decrease the time."
# - The default time of 12 minutes and ability to adjust (e.g., to 18 minutes) are already described in the variable for steam function time setting.

# Features in the provided code:
# 1. "turn_on_off_appliance": Handles turning the appliance on or off.
# 2. "set_and_adjust_menu": Handles selecting the "Steam" menu and adjusting its time.

# Goal variable values for the command:
# - `variable_power_on_off` = "on" (to switch the appliance on).
# - `variable_menu_index` = "Steam" (to select the steam menu).
# - `variable_menu_setting_steam` = 18 (to adjust steam time to 18 minutes).
