# Python comments regarding the user manual and task verification:
# After reviewing the user manual and the given code, we find that the user command to "Turn on the bottle warmer and set the quick warm function for a glass bottle with 2 oz of refrigerated milk, adjusting the time to 3 minutes" can be achieved using the provided code. 
# Below is the step-by-step procedure to achieve the user command:

# 1. The relevant user manual text:
# "QUICK WARM FUNCTION: 
# Tap the power button. All options will appear on the screen.
# Tap the menu button until the “quick” function is selected. 
# The 3 minute default time will appear on the display screen. To adjust the time use the +/- to add or decrease the time."
# 2. Relevant `feature_list` in code:
# Feature name: `"turn_on_off_appliance"` -> This toggles the appliance power between "on" and "off".
# Feature name: `"set_and_adjust_menu"` -> This handles menu selection and time adjustment.
# 3. The goal variable values to achieve the command:
# Set `variable_power_on_off` to `"on"`,
# Set `variable_menu_index` to `"Quick"`,
# Set `variable_menu_setting_quick` to `3`.
