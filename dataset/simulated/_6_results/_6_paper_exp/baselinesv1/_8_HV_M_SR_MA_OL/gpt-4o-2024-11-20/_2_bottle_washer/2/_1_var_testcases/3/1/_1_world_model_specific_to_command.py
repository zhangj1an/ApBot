# User command: Turn on the appliance and heat a silicone bottle that is frozen (0℃) with a volume of 7+ fl-oz.

# The given code already models the relevant appliance features needed to execute the user command.
# Here is the sequence of steps to achieve the command:
# 1. Turn on the appliance: Use the feature `power_and_start_warming`.
#    - User manual: **ON/OFF:** Press this button to turn on the appliance and the light is on. Press again to turn it off and the light is off.
#    - Feature: feature_list["power_and_start_warming"]
#    - Ensure `variable_power_on_off` is set to "on".
# 2. Select the bottle type as silicone: Use the feature `select_bottle_type`.
#    - User manual: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                  |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                  | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
#    - Feature: feature_list["select_bottle_type"]
#    - Ensure `variable_bottle_type` is set to "Silicone".
# 3. Select the initial temperature as frozen (0°C): Use the feature `select_initial_temperature`.
#    - User manual: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                  |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                  | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
#    - Feature: feature_list["select_initial_temperature"]
#    - Ensure `variable_initial_temp` is set to "Frozen".
# 4. Select the volume as 7+ fl-oz: Use the feature `select_volume`.
#    - User manual: | Select bottle | Select initial temp       | Select Volume |
#                  |---------------|---------------------------|---------------|
#                  | Silicone      | Frozen- 0℃ (32℉)          | 7+ fl-oz     |
#    - Feature: feature_list["select_volume"]
#    - Ensure `variable_volume` is set to "7+ fl-oz".
# 5. Start warming: The act of turning on the appliance in `power_and_start_warming` feature also sets `variable_start_running` to "on", so no separate action is needed here.

# Goal Variable Values:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_bottle_type = "Silicone"
# - variable_initial_temp = "Frozen"
# - variable_volume = "7+ fl-oz"
# - variable_start_running = "on"
