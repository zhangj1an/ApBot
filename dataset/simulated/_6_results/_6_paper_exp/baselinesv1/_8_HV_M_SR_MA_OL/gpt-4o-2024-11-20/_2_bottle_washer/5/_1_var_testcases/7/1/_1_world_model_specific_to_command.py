# The given code appears to adequately model the relevant appliance features required to execute the user command:
# "Power the washer on and perform a short sterilization cycle for 10 minutes, keep it in storage mode."

# Below is the sequence of features needed to achieve this command based on the user manual and implemented code:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to power the washer on.
# 2. Use the "sterilise_only_function" feature to set a short sterilization cycle for 10 minutes.
# 3. Use the "storage_function" feature to set the device in storage mode.

# Relevant user manual text outlining the appliance's capabilities:
# - "Press this button to switch the steriliser on and off."
# - "Press this button once for 10 minutes sterilisation and twice for 35 minutes sterilisation."
# - "Press this button alongside any of the functions above to allow items to be stored in the steriliser."

# The corresponding feature list names from the given code are:
# - "power_on_off"
# - "sterilise_only_function"
# - "storage_function"

# The goal variable values to achieve this user command are:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to `"on"`.
# - Set `variable_sterilise_only_duration` to `"10 minutes"`.
# - Set `variable_storage_mode` to `"on"`.
