#    - Relevant user manual quote: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
#    - Feature name: "power_on_off".
# 2. Activate the "adjust_fan_speed" feature to set the fan speed to "low".
#    - Relevant user manual quote: "Press the (fan speed) FAN SPEED button repeatedly until the desired speed is illuminated on the control panel. There are 4 fan speeds: Low, Medium, High and Turbo."
#    - Feature name: "adjust_fan_speed".

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# - Set variable_fan_speed to "low".
