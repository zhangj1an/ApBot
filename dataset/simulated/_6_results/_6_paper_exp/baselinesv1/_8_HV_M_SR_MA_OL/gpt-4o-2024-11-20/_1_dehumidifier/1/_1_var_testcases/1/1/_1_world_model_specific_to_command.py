# The existing code correctly models the relevant appliance features to achieve the user command:
# "Turn on the dehumidifier and set the humidity to 50%".
# Below is the analysis and reasoning:

# 1. The user manual states:
#    - "Press POWER, the Dehumidifier Starts Operation."
#      This is correctly modeled using `feature_list["power_on_off"]` and the action `press_power_button`.
#    - "Humidity can be set in Auto mode, wind speed can be adjusted in air purification mode and wind mode."
#      This is modeled using `feature_list["adjust_humidity"]` and the action `press_humidity_button`.

# 2. Features needed to achieve the command using the given code:
#    - "power_on_off" to turn on the appliance, which toggles `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
#    - "adjust_humidity" to set the humidity level, which adjusts `variable_humidity_level` to "50".

# 3. Goal Variable Values:
#    - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
#    - `variable_humidity_level`: "50"
