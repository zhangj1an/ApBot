# User command: Turn on the dehumidifier and set it to purification mode.

# The current code accurately models the relevant features to achieve the user command. The steps required to execute the command are:
# 1. Activate the "power_on_off" feature to turn on the dehumidifier using the action `press_power_button`.
# 2. Use the "mode_selection" feature to set the dehumidifier to "purification" mode by cycling through the available modes using `press_mode_button` until the desired mode is selected.

# Relevant user manual text:
# - **POWER**: start or shut down the dehumidifier. (Used for the `power_on_off` feature.)
# - **MODE**: select auto dehumidification, Continuous dehumidification, Drying clothes, purification and ventilation, etc. (Used for the `mode_selection` feature.)

# Relevant feature_list:
# - "power_on_off": [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]
# - "mode_selection": [
#       {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_mode_button"], "variable": "variable_mode_selection"},
#       {"step": 2, "actions": ["press_and_hold_mode_button"], "variable": "variable_child_lock"}
#   ]

# Goal variable values:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_mode_selection` to "purification".
