# The requested user command was: 
# "Power up the dehumidifier and ensure the timer is set to '4H' for continuous operation during a dinner party."

# According to the provided user manual and feature list:

# **Relevant Raw User Manual Text**:
# 1. "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# (Models powering on/off with "variable_power_on_off" in the feature "power_on_off.")
# 2. "The air purifier can be set to operate for timed intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours, and 8 hours, stopping automatically when the selected operating time has elapsed."
# (Models setting timer with "variable_timer" in the feature "set_timer.")

# **Relevant Features**:
# 1. feature_list["power_on_off"]:
#    {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}
# 2. feature_list["set_timer"]:
#    {"step": 1, "actions": ["press_timer_button"], "variable": "variable_timer"}

# **Confirmation Regarding the Current Code**:
# The code correctly models both:
# 1. Powering ON/OFF the dehumidifier through "press_power_button".
#    - Maps to variable_power_on_off with values ["on", "off"].
# 2. Setting the timer through "press_timer_button".
#    - Maps to variable_timer with values ["2H", "4H", "8H", "off"].

# **Steps to Achieve the Command**:
# 1. Execute feature_list["power_on_off"] to turn the device "on".
# 2. Execute feature_list["set_timer"] to cycle the timer until it reaches "4H".

# **Goal Variable Values**:
# Set variable_power_on_off to "on".
# Set variable_timer to "4H".
