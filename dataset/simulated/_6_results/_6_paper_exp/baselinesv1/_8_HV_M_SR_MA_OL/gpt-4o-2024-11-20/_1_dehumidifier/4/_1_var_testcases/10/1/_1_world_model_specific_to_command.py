# The requested user command involves turning the dehumidifier on and setting the fan speed to "medium." 
# After checking the given user manual and provided code:

# Relevant manual text for turning the appliance on:
# User manual: Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate.

# Relevant manual text for adjusting fan speed:
# User manual: Press the (fan speed) FAN SPEED button repeatedly until the desired speed is illuminated on the control panel. There are 4 fan speeds: Low, Medium, High and Turbo.

# The corresponding feature list includes:
# - feature_list["power_on_off"]: To toggle the power with "press_power_button."
# - feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"]: To adjust the fan speed with "press_fan_speed_button."

# All steps required to achieve the user command are clearly modeled in the feature list.

# Sequence of Features:
# 1. Use feature_list["power_on_off"] to turn the appliance on.
# 2. Use feature_list["adjust_fan_speed"] to set the fan speed to "medium."

# The goal variable values are:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_fan_speed = "medium"

# Since the provided code already correctly models the features to achieve the user command, no changes are needed.
