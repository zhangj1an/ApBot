# The current code correctly models the following features needed to achieve the user command:
# - The "power_on_off" feature allows toggling of the power state of the appliance.
# - The "set_fan_speed" feature allows adjusting the fan speed, including setting it to "HIGH".

# Relevant raw user manual text:
# **Power On/Off:** "Press the ‚èª button to turn on/off the unit."
# Feature in the given code: feature_list["power_on_off"]

# **Set Fan Speed:** "Press the Speed Control button to select your preferred fan speed."
# Feature in the given code: feature_list["set_fan_speed"]

# Goal variable values to achieve the user command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on" to power on the device.
# 2. Set `variable_fan_speed` to "HIGH" to adjust the fan speed as requested.
