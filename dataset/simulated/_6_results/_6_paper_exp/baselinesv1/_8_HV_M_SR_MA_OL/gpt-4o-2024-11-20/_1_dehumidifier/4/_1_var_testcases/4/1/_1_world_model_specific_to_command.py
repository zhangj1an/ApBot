# The current code models most of the required appliance features but misses an important aspect:
# The user manual specifies the need for "night mode" to alter the unit's operation for quieter environments: 
# User manual: "To turn on Night Mode, press the (microbe shield) Microbe Shield™/NIGHT MODE button until the Night indicator light starts to blink. 
# After 10 blinks, all indicator lights on the control panel will turn off as the unit enters night mode and the fan speed will automatically change to Low."
# This interaction is not fully captured. While "microbe_shield_night_mode" feature and "variable_microbe_shield_night_mode" exist in the code, the automation of fan speed ("low" during night mode) is missing.
# We need to extend the Simulator to ensure engaging "night_mode" explicitly sets fan speed to "low" when night mode is turned on.

updated_feature_list = copy.deepcopy(feature_list)

class ExtendedSimulator(Simulator):
    def reset(self):
        super().reset()
        # Update the feature list
        self.feature = Feature(feature_list=updated_feature_list, current_value=("empty", 1))

    def press_microbe_shield_night_mode_button(self):
        # Update feature progress
        self.feature.update_progress("press_microbe_shield_night_mode_button")
        current_feature = self.feature.get_current_value()[0]
        if current_feature == "microbe_shield_night_mode":
            # Cycle Microbe Shield, Night Mode, Off
            self.variable_microbe_shield_night_mode.next()
            # Automate fan speed adjustment to "low" when night mode is activated
            if self.variable_microbe_shield_night_mode.get_current_value() == "night_mode":
                self.variable_fan_speed.set_current_value("low")

# Sequence of features to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to power on the device.
# 2. Use the "microbe_shield_night_mode" feature to engage 'night_mode', which also sets fan speed to 'low'.

# User manual text supporting these features:
# - Power On/Off: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# - Night Mode: "To turn on Night Mode, press the (microbe shield) Microbe Shield™/NIGHT MODE button until the Night indicator light starts to blink... the fan speed will automatically change to Low."

# Features referenced from the given code:
# - "power_on_off" to set variable_power_on_off to "on"
# - "microbe_shield_night_mode" to set variable_microbe_shield_night_mode to "night_mode"

# Goal variable values:
# variable_power_on_off: "on"
# variable_microbe_shield_night_mode: "night_mode"
# variable_fan_speed: "low"
