# The current code accurately models the relevant features and variables to achieve the requested command:
# "Switch on the dehumidifier and change the fan speed to LOW."

# According to the user manual:
# 1. To turn on/off the unit: "Press the ‚èª button to turn on/off the unit."
#    This feature is captured as "power_on_off" in the given `feature_list`.
#    It uses `variable_power_on_off` to toggle between "on" and "off".
#
# 2. To change the fan speed: The "Fan Speed Control" adjusts between HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, and AUTO.
#    This feature is captured as "set_fan_speed" in the given `feature_list`.
#    It uses `variable_fan_speed` to cycle through the available fan speed options.

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# - "power_on_off" to switch on the unit.
# - "set_fan_speed" to change the fan speed to LOW.

# Relevant feature list in the given code:
# feature_list["power_on_off"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_on_off_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}]
# feature_list["set_fan_speed"] = [{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_speed_uv_button"], "variable": "variable_fan_speed"}]

# The goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# - Set `variable_fan_speed` to "LOW".
