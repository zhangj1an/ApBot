# The current simulation correctly models the variable for timer adjustment (variable_timer) and the functionality required for power_on_off (variable_power_on_off). 
# The user manual sections related to these aspects are correctly implemented.
# Sequence of features needed to achieve the command:
# 1. Use the "power_on_off" feature to turn the power on. [Feature name: "power_on_off"]
#    Raw user manual text: "Press the (power) POWER button to turn on and the (power) POWER symbol light will illuminate."
# 2. Use the "set_timer" feature to adjust the timer to '8H'. [Feature name: "set_timer"]
#    Raw user manual text: "The air purifier can be set to operate for timed intervals of 2 hours, 4 hours and 8 hours, stopping automatically when the selected operating time has elapsed."

# Goal variable values:
# variable_power_on_off = "on"
# variable_timer = "8H"
