# The given code seems to have accurately modeled the features necessary to perform the command: 
# "Turn the dehumidifier on and adjust the fan speed to 'mid.'"
# The sequence of features required to achieve this command is:
# 1. Use the "power_control" feature to turn the unit on.
# 2. Use the "adjust_fan_speed" feature to set the fan speed to 'mid.'
# 
# Relevant user manual texts:
# - "Turns the unit on and off." (models `power_control` feature, variable: `variable_power_on_off`)
# - "Fan/Air Speed (SPEED): 1. Low, 2. Mid, 3. High" (models `adjust_fan_speed` feature, variable: `variable_fan_speed`)
#
# Corresponding feature list names in the given code:
# - "power_control"
# - "adjust_fan_speed"
#
# Goal variable values to achieve the command:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on"
# - Set `variable_fan_speed` to "2" (mid)
