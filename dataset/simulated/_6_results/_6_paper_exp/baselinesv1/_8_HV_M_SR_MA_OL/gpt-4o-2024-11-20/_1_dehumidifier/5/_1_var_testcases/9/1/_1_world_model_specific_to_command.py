# The given code correctly models the features described in the user manual. The necessary features are already adequately represented
# through the feature_list in the Simulator class. Specifically:

# To achieve the user command "Power on the dehumidifier and ensure the sleep mode is 'off'", 
# the sequence of features required is as follows:
# 1. Use feature_list["power_control"] to toggle the power state to 'on'.
# 2. Use feature_list["enable_sleep_mode"] to ensure the sleep mode is 'off'.

# Raw user manual text supporting these features:
# 1. "Power Button (ON/OFF): Turns the unit on and off."
# 2. "Sleep (SLEEP): Press to send the display to sleep. The unit will continue working on the low fan mode but the lights will turn off."

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# 1. Set `variable_power_on_off` to "on".
# 2. Set `variable_sleep_mode` to "off".
