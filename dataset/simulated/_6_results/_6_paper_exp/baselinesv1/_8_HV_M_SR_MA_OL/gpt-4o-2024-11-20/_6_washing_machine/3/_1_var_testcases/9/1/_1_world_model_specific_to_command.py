# The given code has the correct modelling of all features relevant to the provided user command:
# 1. Variable `variable_power_on_off` correctly models the power toggle functionality.
# 2. Variable `variable_program_selection` and feature `select_program` model selecting the "Normal" program.
# 3. Variable `variable_water_level` and feature `adjust_water_level` model setting the water level to 32 L.
# 4. Variable `variable_preset_timer` and feature `adjust_preset_timer` model setting to finish in 7 hours.
# 5. Variable `variable_start_running` and feature `start_operation` model starting the appliance.
# 6. Variable `variable_child_lock` and feature `set_child_lock` model activating the child lock.

# The sequence of features needed to achieve this command is as follows:
# 1. "toggle_power" (to turn on the power).
#   User manual:
#   - "Power On/Off - The power turns off automatically if you do not press 'Start/Pause' within 10 minutes after power-on."

#   - Feature: "select_program" in the code.
#
# 3. "adjust_water_level" (to set the water level to 32 L).
#   User manual:
#   - "Change Water Level - During the wash process, press 'Water Level' to change the water level."
#   - Feature: "adjust_water_level" in the code.
#
# 4. "adjust_preset_timer" (to set the timer to 7 hours).
#   User manual:
#   - "Preset - Set the time to finish washing (in hours)."
#   - Feature: "adjust_preset_timer" in the code.
#
# 5. "start_operation" (to start the washing process).
#   User manual:

#   - "Setting Child Lock - To prevent children from falling into the tub and drowning, if the lid is opened while the washing machine is operating, this function sounds a buzzer until it is closed."
#   - Feature: "set_child_lock" in the code.
#
# Goal variable values:
# - `variable_power_on_off`: "on"
# - `variable_program_selection`: "1 Normal"
# - `variable_water_level`: "32 L"
# - `variable_preset_timer`: 7
# - `variable_start_running`: "on"
# - `variable_child_lock`: "on"
