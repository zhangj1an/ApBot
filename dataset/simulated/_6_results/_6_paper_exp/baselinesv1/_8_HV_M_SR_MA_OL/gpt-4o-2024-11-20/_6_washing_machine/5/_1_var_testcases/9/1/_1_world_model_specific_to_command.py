# The current code accurately models the relevant appliance features required to achieve the user command:
# "Switch on, apply 'Wool' program, use 'High' water, designate 45 minutes, perform '3 Times' rinse, spin 'Regular'." 

# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. "on_off" - Turn on the appliance.
#    - User manual: **1 On/Off button** Product is switched On or Off.
#    - Feature list: feature_list["on_off"]
# 2. "set_program" - Select the 'Wool' program.
#    - User manual: **3 Program buttons** Available according to the laundry type.
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_program"]
# 3. "set_water_level" - Set 'High' water level (mapped to the last value of water levels, depending on convention).
#    - User manual: **Water Level** Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers.
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_water_level"]
# 4. "set_time_manager" - Designate the time manager (mapped to a value that represents 45 minutes).
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable (interpreted as time manager).
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_time_manager"]
# 5. "set_rinse_times" - Set rinse times to '3 Times'.
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_rinse_times"]
# 6. "set_spin_speed" - Set spin speed to 'Regular'.
#    - User manual: **Function** Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable.
#    - Feature list: feature_list["set_spin_speed"]

# Since the current implementation accurately models the relevant features and variables, no additional changes are required. Below is a minimal ExtendedSimulator class.
