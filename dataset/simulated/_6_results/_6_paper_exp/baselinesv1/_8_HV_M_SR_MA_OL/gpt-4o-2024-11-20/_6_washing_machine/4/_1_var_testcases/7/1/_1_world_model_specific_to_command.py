# According to the description in the user manual and the feature_list provided in the given code,
# the sequence of steps required to achieve the user command is as follows:

# Step 1: Turn on the washing machine.
# - Relevant user manual quote: 
#   "Press this button to switch power on and off. The washing machine automatically switches off when operations are finished."
# - Relevant feature: "power_on_off"

# - Relevant feature: "adjust_program"

# Step 3: Set the water limit to 25 L.
# - Relevant user manual quote: 
#   "You can set the amount of water each time you press the Water Level button in a range from 25 to 59 L."
# - Relevant feature: "adjust_water_level"

# Step 4: Set the washing time to 9 minutes.
# - Relevant user manual quote: 
#   "Changes the washing time. The washing time can be set between 3 and 18 minutes."
# - Relevant feature: "adjust_wash_time"

# Step 5: Set the rinse type to 'Water-Injection Rinse 2 times'.
# - Relevant user manual quote:

# - Relevant user manual quote: 
#   "Starts and pauses operation. When the washing machine is paused for over one hour and no operations are done, it turns off automatically."
# - Relevant feature: "start_pause"

# The current code correctly models features to achieve the command because each step is distinctly represented in the feature_list. 

# The goal variable values to achieve this command are:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_program = "P9 (Small Load)"
# - variable_water_level = 25
# - variable_washing_time = 9
# - variable_rinse_type = "Water-Injection Rinse 2 times"
# - variable_spin_time = 1
# - variable_start_running = "start"
