# The existing implementation of the Simulator accurately models the features and variables required to execute the user command.
# Below is how the given user command is aligned with the existing feature_list in the Simulator class.

# **Features Needed**:
# 1. "power_adjust" to turn the washing machine on (# User manual: Press this button once to turn the washing machine on).
# 2. "adjust_cycle_selector" to set the washing cycle to "Baby Care".
# 3. "adjust_temperature" to set the washing temperature to "60°C".
# 4. "adjust_spin_speed" to set the spin speed to "800 rpm".
# 5. "adjust_options" to set the washing option to "Intensive".
# 6. "adjust_delay_end" to set the delay end timer to "5 hours".
# 7. "start_pause_cycle" to start the washing machine.

# **User Manual Text**:
# - Power On/Off: "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
# - Cycle Selector: "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle."
# - Temp. Button: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options: (Cold water 🌡️, 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, 60°C, and 95°C)."
# - Spin Button: "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle."
# - Option Button: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak > Intensive > Prewash > Rinse+ > Soak + Rinse+ > Intensive + Rinse+ > Prewash + Rinse+ > Off."
# - Delay End: "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one-hour increments)."
# - Start/Pause: "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle."

# **Existing Feature Mappings in Code**:
# - "power_adjust" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_power_button"], "variable": "variable_power_on_off"}`
# - "adjust_cycle_selector" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["turn_cycle_selector_dial_clockwise", "turn_cycle_selector_dial_anticlockwise"], "variable": "variable_cycle_selector"}`
# - "adjust_temperature" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_temp_button"], "variable": "variable_temperature"}`
# - "adjust_spin_speed" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_spin_button"], "variable": "variable_spin_speed"}`
# - "adjust_options" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_option_button"], "variable": "variable_option"}`
# - "adjust_delay_end" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_delay_end_button"], "variable": "variable_delay_end"}`
# - "start_pause_cycle" -> `{"step": 1, "actions": ["press_start_pause_button"], "variable": "variable_start_running"}`

# **Goal Variable Values**:
# - Set `variable_power_on_off` to `"on"` to power on the washing machine.
# - Set `variable_cycle_selector` to `"Baby Care"` for washing baby clothes with extra care.
# - Set `variable_temperature` to `"60°C"` to adjust the temperature.
# - Set `variable_spin_speed` to `"800"` to adjust the spin speed.
# - Set `variable_option` to `"Intensive"` for intensive washing options.
# - Set `variable_delay_end` to `5` hours using the delay feature.
# - Set `variable_start_running` to `"on"` to start the machine.

# All the required features and variables are already implemented accurately in the Simulator, so no modifications are needed.
