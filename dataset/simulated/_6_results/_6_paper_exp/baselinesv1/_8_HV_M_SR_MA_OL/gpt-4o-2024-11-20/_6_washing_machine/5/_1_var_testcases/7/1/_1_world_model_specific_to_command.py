# The current code accurately models the washing machine's relevant features and contains no missing appliance variables or features described in the user manual for executing the given command. Below, we outline the sequence of features with corresponding user manual references and goal variable values.

# Sequence of Features Needed:
# 1. Turn on the washing machine. 
#    - User Manual Reference: "1 On/Off button - Product is switched On or Off."
#    - Feature in Code: "on_off"
# 2. Select the 'Quick Wash' program.
#    - User Manual Reference: "3 Program buttons - Available according to the laundry type."
#    - Feature in Code: "set_program"
# 3. Set water level to 'Low' (assuming level 2 for 'Low').
#    - User Manual Reference: "**Water Level** - Select water level according to clothing categories."
#    - Feature in Code: "set_water_level"
# 4. Select rinse cycle '2 Times.'
#    - User Manual Reference: "Function -> Rinse times - Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time..."
#    - Feature in Code: "set_rinse_times"
# 5. Set spin speed to 'Regular.'
#    - User Manual Reference: "Function -> Spin speed - Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time..."
#    - Feature in Code: "set_spin_speed"
# 6. Set time (while a time variable is described, there is no clear mention of adjusting the time in the user manual, hence this step is invalid).

# Goal Variable Values to Achieve Command:
# Variable: variable_on_off -> Value: "on"
# Variable: variable_program -> Value: "Quick Wash"
# Variable: variable_water_level -> Value: "2" (assumed as 'Low')
# Variable: variable_rinse_times -> Value: "2 times"
# Variable: variable_spin_speed -> Value: "Medium/Regular" (considered Regular equivalent)

# Since feature for setting a specific numeric time (e.g., 15 minutes) is not defined in the user manual, there is no update to feature_list or variables for this additional capability.
