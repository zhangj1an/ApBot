# The given code already accurately models the relevant appliance features required to achieve the user command: 
# - Power On: feature_list["power_adjust"]
# - Select Synthetics Cycle: feature_list["adjust_cycle_selector"]
# - Adjust Temperature to Cold Water: feature_list["adjust_temperature"]
# - Set Spin Speed to 1200 rpm: feature_list["adjust_spin_speed"]
# - Set Rinse+ Option: feature_list["adjust_options"]
# - Set Delay to 5 Hours: feature_list["adjust_delay_end"]
# - Start the Machine: feature_list["start_pause_cycle"]

# Relevant user manual text:
# 1. "Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off."
#    (feature_list["power_adjust"])
# 2. "Select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle." (feature_list["adjust_cycle_selector"])
# 3. "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available water temperature options:"
#    Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 95 °C. (feature_list["adjust_temperature"])
# 4. "Press the button repeatedly to cycle through the available speeds for the spin cycle." (feature_list["adjust_spin_speed"])
# 5. "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the options: Soak > Intensive > Prewash > Rinse+ > ... > off."
#    (feature_list["adjust_options"])
# 6. "Press this button repeatedly to cycle through the available Delay End options (from 3 hours to 19 hours in one hour increments)."
#    (feature_list["adjust_delay_end"])
# 7. "Press this button to pause and restart a cycle." (feature_list["start_pause_cycle"])

# Goal Variables to Achieve User Command:
# 1. variable_power_on_off = "on" (Power On)
# 2. variable_cycle_selector = "Synthetics" (Select Synthetics Cycle)
# 3. variable_temperature = "Cold water" (Set Cold Water Temperature)
# 4. variable_spin_speed = "1200" (Set Spin Speed to 1200 rpm)
# 5. variable_option = "Rinse+" (Set Rinse+ Option)
# 6. variable_delay_end = 5 (Set Delay End to 5 Hours)
# 7. variable_start_running = "on" (Start the Machine)
