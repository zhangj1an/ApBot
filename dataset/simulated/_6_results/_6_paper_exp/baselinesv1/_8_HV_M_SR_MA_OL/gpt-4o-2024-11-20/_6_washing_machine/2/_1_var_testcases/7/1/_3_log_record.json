According to rule 3, when values contain both numbers and text, the text should be removed and only the numbers should be compared. However, in this case, the goal state explicitly includes a specific formatting ('3---large'), which is not just a number but a combination of text and numbers. Rule 5 also states that if there is an option that matches the goal value better than the feedback value, the goal has not been reached. Since '3---large' is more specific and is the exact goal value, and the feedback only shows '3', the goal has not been reached yet. Since this is open loop execution, given a wrong model, we will terminate now. "
