# The current code already correctly models the necessary features and variables to accomplish the given user command,
# "Power on and wash outdoor sportswear, using Outdoor Care cycle, 40 °C temperature, 1000 rpm spin speed, Soak + Rinse+ option, set delay to 5 hours, and start the machine."
# Here is the sequence of features to achieve this:

# 1. "power_adjust" to turn the power on. 
# (User manual: Press this button once to turn the washing machine on. Then press this button again to turn it off.)

# 2. "adjust_cycle_selector" to set the washing cycle to "Outdoor Care".
# (User manual: Cycle selector is used to select the tumble pattern and spin speed for the cycle.)

# 3. "adjust_temperature" to set the water temperature to 40 °C.
# (User manual: Temp button cycles through available water temperature options: Cold water 🌡️, 20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C and 95 °C.)

# 4. "adjust_spin_speed" to set the spin speed to 1000 rpm.
# (User manual: Spin button cycles through available speeds: Rinse Hold, 🚫, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400 rpm.)

# 5. "adjust_options" to select the "Soak + Rinse+" option.
# (User manual: Options button cycles through options: Soak, Intensive, Prewash, Rinse+, Soak + Rinse+, Intensive + Rinse+, Prewash + Rinse+, off.)

# 6. "adjust_delay_end" to set the Delay End timer to 5 hours.
# (User manual: Delay End button cycles through delay options from 3 hours to 19 hours in one-hour increments.)

# 7. "start_pause_cycle" to start the washing machine.
# (User manual: Start/Pause button is used to pause and restart a cycle.)

# Below are the final variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_power_on_off = "on"
# - variable_cycle_selector = "Outdoor Care"
# - variable_temperature = "40°C"
# - variable_spin_speed = "1000"
# - variable_option = "Soak + Rinse+"
# - variable_delay_end = 5
# - variable_start_running = "on"
