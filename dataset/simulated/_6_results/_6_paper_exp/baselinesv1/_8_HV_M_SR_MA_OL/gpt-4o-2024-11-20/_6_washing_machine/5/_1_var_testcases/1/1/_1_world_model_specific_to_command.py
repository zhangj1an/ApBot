# Python comment:
# The current Simulator already accurately models the userâ€™s requested commands as follows:
# Sequence of features needed to achieve this command:
# 1. Feature "on_off" (to turn on the washing machine with action "press_on_off_button")
# 2. Feature "set_program" (to set the washing program to 'Regular' using action "press_program_buttons")
# 3. Feature "set_water_level" (to set water level to 'High', interpreted as the highest value possible, using action "press_water_level_button")
# 4. Feature "set_time_manager" (to allocate time management to 45 minutes using action "press_time_manager_button")
# 5. Feature "set_rinse_times" (to set rinse times to '2 Times' using action "press_rinse_button")
# 6. Feature "set_spin_speed" (to set spin type/speed to 'Regular' using action "press_spin_button")

# User manual text relevant to features:
# - "1 On/Off button: Product is switched On or Off."
# - "3 Program buttons: Available according to the laundry type."
# - "Water Level: Select water level according to clothing categories, degree of soiling and washing habits of customers."
# - "Function: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."
# - "Time Manager, Rinse Hold, Spin: Washing time, rinsing times, spinning time and other settings can be selectable."

# Feature list names in the given code:
# - "on_off"
# - "set_program"
# - "set_water_level"
# - "set_time_manager"
# - "set_rinse_times"
# - "set_spin_speed"

# Goal variable values to achieve this command:
# - variable_on_off: "on"
# - variable_program: "Regular"
# - variable_water_level: "6" (interpreted as the highest value for 'High')
# - variable_time_manager: "5" (assumed as 45 minutes given increments correspond to smaller time scales)
# - variable_rinse_times: "2 times"
# - variable_spin_speed: "Medium" (interpreted as Regular setting based on feature list and manual)
